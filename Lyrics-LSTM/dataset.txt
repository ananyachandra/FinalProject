i'm not concerned with people
who prey on the wealth of their fellow man
cause they only want to know you, enroll you
only for the things ya had
i just think its so sad
get dem haters out your circle
smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
see them try to mess to hurt you
and work you
anything to bring ya down
they keep evil thoughts in their hearts
you can't let them knock your hustle
not letting them know how much you struggle
they turn green with envy when your on top
and dem heart is full with strife
their by gonna try to take your life
ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
dont be fooled u betta recognize
they not there for you
they dont care for you
trust me cuz i know its true
ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
then they turn against you when your not around
its just jealousy and dishonesty
so hold on to your sanity

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
another one

the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far

and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy

there could be a freak accident
there could be a fatal disease
i know we hate to think about it
but this as real
as you and me
this as real
as you and me
we could all fall down
before our savior could return
i know we hate to think about it
but this as real
as you and me
if i should go
hold my hand
if i should leave
time cover me, please
the earth could quake to ruin
we could drift off in our sleep
i know we hate to think about it
but this as real
as you and me
this as real
as you and me
the ocean crushed the shore
and take us down forever more
i know we hate to think about it
but this as real
as you and me
if i should go
hold my hand
if i should leave
time cover me, please
i know we hate to think about it
but this as real
as you and me
this as real
as you and me
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly

as i was walkin' down the road to bethlehem one night
i looked up to the sky and there i saw a wondrous sight
a star was shining brighter than i'd ever seen before
and a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
they said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
with great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl
a child is born
on this holy night
and all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
so come to see
mary's sweet baby
and let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
so peacefully
oh yeah
as i went down into the town to see what i could see
three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
they said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
so wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
and ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone
a child is born
on this holy night
and all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
so come to see
mary's sweet baby
and let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
so peacefully
hallelujah
so wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
and ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone
a child is born
on this holy night
and all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
so come to see
mary's sweet baby
and let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
so peacefully

chest to chest
nose to nose
palm to palm
we were always just that close
wrist to wrist
toe to toe
lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it feels like more than distance between us
in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars
for your heart, for me
my california king
eye to eye
cheek to cheek
side by side
you were sleeping next to me
arm in arm
dusk to dawn
with the curtains drawn
and a little last night on these sheets
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it seems like more than distance between us
in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars
for your heart, for me
my california king
guitar
just when i felt like giving up on us
you turned around and gave me one last touch
that made everything feel better
and even then my eyes got wetter
so confused when i asked you if you love me
but i don't wanna seem so weak
maybe i've been california dreaming
in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars
for your heart, for me
my california king
guitar
my california king
in this california king bed
we're ten thousand miles apart
i've been california wishing on the stars
for your heart for me
my california king
nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
watching you pretend you're unaffected
you're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
but i won't
no you don't need my protection
but i'm in love, can't blame me for checking
i love in your direction, hoping that the message goes
somewhere close to you
close to you
like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
just say now, i'm coming right now, to be close to you
said you let it go, you kept it
working hard to perfect it
now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
would you let it go?
no you don't need my protection
but i'm in love, can't blame me for checking
i love in your direction, hoping that the message goes
somewhere close to you
close to you
like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
if you let me, i'd be there by now
close to you
i'm not the type to get my heart broken
i'm not the type to get upset and cry
cause i never leave my heart open
never hurts me to say goodbye
relationships don't get deep to me
never got the whole 'in love' thing
and someone can say they love me truly
but at the time it didn't mean a thing
my mind is gone, i'm spinnin' 'round
and deep inside my tears i'll drown
i'm losin' grip, what's happenin'?
i strayed from love, this is how i feel
this time was different
felt like i was just a victim
and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm in this condition
and i've got all the symptoms
of a girl with a broken heart
but no matter what you'll never see me cry
did it happen when we first kissed?
cause it's hurtin' me to let it go
maybe 'cause we spent so much time
and i know that it's no more
i shoulda never let you hold me baby
maybe why i'm sad to see us apart
i didn't give it to you on purpose
gotta figure out how you stole my heart
my mind is gone, i'm spinnin' 'round
and deep inside my tears i'll drown
i'm losin' grip, what's happenin'?
i strayed from love, this is how i feel
this time was different
felt like i was just a victim
and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm in this condition
and i've got all the symptoms
of a girl with a broken heart
but no matter what you'll never see me cry
how did i get here with you? i'll never know
i never meant to let it get so personal
and after all i tried to do, stay away from lovin' you
i'm broken hearted, i can't let you know
and i won't let it show, you won't see me cry
this time was different
felt like i was just a victim
and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm in this condition
and i've got all the symptoms
of a girl with a broken heart
but no matter what you'll never see me cry
this time was different
felt like i was just a victim
and it cut me like a knife
when you walked out of my life
now i'm in this condition
and i've got all the symptoms
of a girl with a broken heart
but no matter what you'll never see me cry
all my life

i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real

so you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know

when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you but i'll lie if i have to
cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
i left a note on my bedpost
said, not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
what i tend to do when it comes to you
i see only the good, selective memory
the way you make me feel, yeah
you gotta hold on me
i've never met someone so different
oh, here we go

so where you go, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh

i can't remember to forget you
i go back again, fall off the train
land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
what i'm trying to say is not to forget
you see only the good, selective memory
the way he makes me feel like
the way he makes me feel
i never seemed to act so stupid
oh, here we go

so where he goes, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
tell me that you love me
when you know you don't love me
but i guess i guess i guess it's all good
you can play the game
i'm a still do my thing
ain't no better way for it to be put
when you fuck them other girls
i bet they be wondering why you always call my name
you think i'm gonna wait around

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair

the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare

just live your life
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life
cause i'm a paper chaser
just livin' my life  my life

look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop

livin the life, the life

go hard or go home, back to your residence
soon as the red dogs give the block back to the presidents
i used to run my whole block like obama and them
you ain't gotta believe me  go ask my momma and them
couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
look like me and two of my boys playing casino
count the style i keep in my bag, they can't afford it
tell 'em give me back my swag!  they trying to clone it
see my louis chucks, louis flag, louis frames, louis belt

i'm in the allwhite party wearing all black
with my new black watch, call it the heart attack
cardiac arrest, carti'ac a wrist
yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this

i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly

the way you make me feel, yeah
you gotta hold on me
i've never met someone so different
oh, here we go
you a part of me now, you a part of me
so where you go, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i keep forgetting i should let you go
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i can't remember to forget you
i go back again, fall off the train
land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
what i'm trying to say is not to forget
you see only the good, selective memory
the way he makes me feel like
the way he makes me feel
i never seemed to act so stupid
oh, here we go
he a part of me now, he a part of me
so where he goes, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i keep forgetting i should let you go
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i rob and i kill to keep him with me
i do anything for that boy
i'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
i do anything for that boy
i rob and i kill to keep him with me
i do anything for that boy
i'd give my last dime to hold him tonight

ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh

i keep forgetting i should let you go
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight

i can't remember to forget you
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
tryna run from that, say you done with that
on your face, girl, it just don't show
when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you but i'll lie if i have to
cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
now this be the last time you did me wrong
no more laying up in your arms
no calling, saying you want me back
i'm packing my bags, what you think about that?
stayed at home like a good girl do
but tonight baby you got me sad and blue
i just heard about the girl in your car now, kissing at the bar
got me crying
ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
cause you took my love
oh you took my love
now you got me like whoahhh
you got me hatin' on the club
cause you took my love
why'd you have to take my love
whoahh
and you can be mad at me all you want
i ain't coming in, i'll be waiting out front
coming out the door with your girlfriend
you did me wrong boy tell me where our love is
stayed at home like a good girl do
but tonight baby you got me sad and blue
i just heard about the girl in your car now, kissing at the bar
got me crying
ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
cause you took my love
oh you took my love
now you got me like whoahhh
you got me hatin' on the club
cause you took my love
why'd you have to take my love
whoahh
now this is the sound of a broken heart
there's only one reason why we're apart
she never woulda made it to your car
if it wasn't for the club, i'd still have my love
we would still have us
i'd still have my love
we would still have us
but now we're like whoahhhh
ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
cause you took my love
oh you took my love
but now, now we're like whoahhh
you got me hatin' on the club
you took my love
oh you took my love
you say you love me
but they feel like words to me
but this just ain't working
stop thinking
you can run over me
drifting, settling off to a foreign place
if i can't see what's in front of me
it's a mystery
well than apparently
things just ain't the same
and i'm ready for change
go on, be gone, bye bye, so long
can't you see that your fading
fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away
i opened up my eyes
and i finally realized
today, today, it's too late
you're fading away
put a sock in it
just stop running your mouth
got my mind made up
i ain't coming back again
no way, no way, no way, no way
cause i'm so fed up
boy you got me messed up
if you hit me back up
don't press your luck today, today
i'm blowing you away
things just ain't the same
and i'm ready for change
go on, be gone, ta ta, so long
can't you see that your fading
fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away
i opened up my eyes
and i finally realized
today, today, it's too late
you're fading away
saw you turn into a ghost
right in front of my eyes
tell me what's a girl to do
when she's crying inside
i'm about to go insane
i'm jumping off this train
whether wrong of right
i'll be gone by night
can't you see that your fading
fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away
i opened up my eyes
and i finally realized
today, today, it's too late
you're fading away
i rest my hand across your lips
feel your breath by my fingertips
no longer can i delay what is right
but this love it wont give up without a fight
id write a note and tear it up
there are no words that could say enough
i know i'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
but i swear its gonna hurt me even more
you taught me how to laugh
you taught me how to cry
when i gave up you even taught me how to try
there's one more thing to learn before i spread my wings and fly
you gonna have to teach me how to say
goodbye, goodbye
wish i could see your dreams tonight
wish i could make them turn out right
tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
but my heart tells me its better just like this
so this is how the story ends
when love is gone you cant pretend
no matter who else i give my heart to
there's a part of it that still belongs to you
you taught me how to laugh
you taught me how to cry
when i gave up you even taught me how to try
there's one more thing to learn before i spread my wings and fly
you gonna have to teach me how to say
goodbye, goodbye
you made me strong when i was weak
gave my heart a voice to speak
you mustve known this day will come
when the lessons are all done
all except for one, no
you taught me how to laugh
you taught me how to cry
when i gave up you even taught me how to try
there's one more thing to learn before i spread my wings and fly
you gonna have to teach me how to say
goodbye
you gonna have to teach me how to say
goodbye

now as the summer fades
i let you slip away
you say i'm not your type
but i can make you sway
it makes you burn to learn
you're not the only one
i'd let you be if you
put down your blazing gun
now you've gone somewhere else
far away
i don't know if i will find you
but you feel my breath
on your neck
can't believe i'm right behind you
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
and if i never see your face again
i don't mind
cause we gone much further than i thought we'd get tonight
sometimes you move so well
it's hard not to give in
i'm lost, i can't tell
where you end and i begin
it makes me burn to learn
you're with another man
i wonder if he's half
the lover that i am
now you've gone somewhere else
far away
i don't know if i will find you
but you feel my breath
on your neck
can't believe i'm right behind you
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
and if i never see your face again
i don't mind
cause we gone much further than i thought we'd get tonight
baby, baby
please believe me
find it in your heart to reach me
promise not to leave me behind
take me down, but take it easy
make me think but don't deceive me
talk to me bout taking your time
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
and if i never see your face again
i don't mind
cause we gone much further than i thought we'd get tonight
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
and if i never see your face again
i don't mind
cause we got much further than i thought we'd get tonight
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ain't nothin wrong with it

i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair

amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you'd still be wastin' days away now had i never saved the day
consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
like i once made 'em spray, now i could make 'em put the k's away
been thuggin' all my life, can't say i don't deserve to take a break
you'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare

allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
articulate, but still i'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler tip
if that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
i got love for the game, but ay i'm not in love with all of it
could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare
so live your life
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life
cause i'm a paper chaser
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life  just livin' my life
got everybody watchin' what i do, come walk in my shoes
and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
we gon' post up on the top spot
livin the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me
the life, my life
i do it how i wanna do
i'm livin' my life, my life
i will never lose
i'm livin' my life, my liiiife
and i'll never stop it
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha
so live your life
on the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, oh, i love the way you lie
now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war you'll always win
even when i'm right
cause you feed me fables from your head
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, oh, i love the way you lie, oh
so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run but i don't wanna ever leave
till the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
this morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby, speak softly, tell me i'll be sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each others backs 'cause we're that lucky
together, we move mountains
let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
i may have hit you three times, i'm startin' to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts but i refused counsellin'
this house is too huge, if you move out i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
with you i'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, i'm out it
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie, i love the way you lie
i said i'm geeked and i'm fired up
all i want tonight just get high up

i knew your face once, but now it's unclear
and i can't feel my body now
i separate from here and now
a drug and a dream
a lost connection, oh, come back to me
so i can feel alive again
as soul and body try to mend
it's pulling me apart this time
everything is neverending
i slipped into a parallel
they'll never understand
this feeling always gets away
wishing i could hold on longer
why does it have to feel so strange
to be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa
on the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
oh, i love the way you lie
now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war you'll always win
even when i'm right
cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
oh, i love the way you lie
so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run but i don't wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
it's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
i may have hit you three times, i'm startin' to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but i refuse counsellin'
this house is too huge, if you move out i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
cause with you i'm in my fuckin' mind, without you i'm out it
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
oh, i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ladies and gentleman
to those among you who are easily frightened
we suggest you turn away now
to those of you who think you can take it
we say welcome to the mad house
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh

na, na, na, na, na, na, na
come on, come on, come on in
come on, come on in
took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
opened up, let you in my world
like a dance, started slow and then love took control
swept away, so proud to be your girl
when you write a story much to fast
sometimes a happy ending doesn't last
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when it's right it's so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
remember when, we said our love would last forever
but then again, how are we to know
there come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn
but there'll always be a first time you get burned
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when it's right it's so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
i don't regret a single day
joy and pain along the way
a broken heart's the price we pay
as sad as it may seem
baby can't you see
it's the way it's gotta be
now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when it's right it's so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
yeah
now i know
i know

i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
tryna run from that, say you done with that
on your face, girl, it just don't show
when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you but i'll lie if i have to
cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

baby baby
when we first met i never felt something so strong
you were like my lover and my best friend
all wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
and all of a sudden you went and left
i didn't know how to follow
it's like a shock that spun me around
and now my heart's dead
i feel so empty and hollow
and i'll never give myself to another the way i gave it to you
you don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
it's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
and you're the one to blame
and now i feel like oh!
you're the reason why i'm thinking
i don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
i guess that's what i get for wishful thinking
should've never let you enter my door
next time you wanna go on and leave
i should just let you go on and do it
cause now i'm using like i bleed

and baby, you're my disease
i gotta check into rehab
cause baby you're my disease
i gotta check into rehab
cause baby you're my disease
damn, ain't it crazy when you're loveswept
you'd do anything for the one you love
cause anytime that you needed me i'd be there
it's like you were my favorite drug
the only problem is that you was using me
in a different way than i was using you
but now that i know it's not meant to be
i gotta go, i gotta wean myself off of you
and i'll never give myself to another the way i gave it to you
you don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
it's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
and you're the one to blame

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair

i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly

i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly

ay this a special what's happenin' to all my
all my soldiers over there in iraq
e'rybody right here
what you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
stop lookin' at what you ain't got
start bein' thankful for what you do got
let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare
so live your life
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life
cause i'm a paper chaser
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life  just livin' my life
hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you'd still be wastin' days away now had i never saved the day
consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
like i once made 'em spray, now i could make 'em put the k's away
been thuggin' all my life, can't say i don't deserve to take a break
you'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare
so live your life

i'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
articulate, but still i'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler tip
if that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
i got love for the game, but ay i'm not in love with all of it
could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare
so live your life
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life
cause i'm a paper chaser
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life  just livin' my life
got everybody watchin' what i do, come walk in my shoes
and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
we gon' post up on the top spot
livin the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me
the life, my life
i do it how i wanna do
i'm livin' my life, my life
i will never lose
i'm livin' my life, my liiiife
and i'll never stop it
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya haha

take off my shirt, loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
stare at myself in the mirror
take me apart, piece by piece
sorrow decrease, pressure release
i put in work
did more than called upon, more than deserved
when it was over, did i wind up hurt?
but it taught me, before a decision, ask this question first
who am i living for?
is this my limit?
can i endure some more?
chances are given, question existing
who am i living for?
is this my limit?
can i endure some more?
chances are given, question existing
take off my cool
show them that under here, i'm just like you
do the mistakes that may make me a fool
or a human with loss
and with them a loss, round of applause
take the abuse, sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
it's entertainment, is that an excuse?
but the question that lingers, whether win or lose
who am i living for?
is this my limit?
can i endure some more?

dear diary, it's robyn
entertain is something i do for a living
it's not who i am, i'd like to think that i'm pretty normal
i laugh, i get mad, i hurt, i think i suck sometimes
but when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
sometimes i feel like i have it worst
cause i have to always keep my guard up
i don't know who to trust
i don't know who wants to date me for who i am
or who wants to be my friend for who i really am
who am i living for?

feel like a brand new person
i finally know what is love
stop before it's not too late
i know there's too much at stake
making the same mistakes
and i still don't know why it's happening
and i still don't know
finally taking flight
i know you don't think it's right
i know that you think it's fake
maybe fake's what i like
the point is i have the right
i'm thinking in black and white
i'm thinking it's worth the fight
soon to be out of sight
knowing it all this time
going with what i always longed for
feel like a brand new person
but i don't care i'm in love
feel like a brand new person
so how do i know that it's right?
stop before it's not too late
man, i know that it's hard to digest
but maybe this story ain't so different from the rest
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
and i know that it's hard to digest
a realization is as good as a guess
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
feel like a brand new person
so how will i know that it's right?
in a new direction
so how will i know i've gone too far?
stop thinking you're the only option was
feel like a brand new person
i finally know what it's like
stop thinking you're the only option, oh
so how will i know i've gone too far?
stop thinking you're the only option, oh
and i know it's hard to describe
stop thinking you're the only option, oh
so how will i know that it's right?
stop thinking you're the only option, oh
i finally know what it's like
stop thinking you're the only option, oh

what i tend to do when it comes to you

the way you make me feel, yeah
you gotta hold on me
i've never met someone so different
oh, here we go
you a part of me now, you a part of me
so where you go, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i keep forgetting i should let you go
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i can't remember to forget you
i go back again, fall off the train
land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
what i'm trying to say is not to forget
you see only the good, selective memory
the way he makes me feel like
the way he makes me feel
i never seemed to act so stupid
oh, here we go
he a part of me now, he a part of me
so where he goes, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i keep forgetting i should let you go
but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i rob and i kill to keep him with me
i do anything for that boy
i'd give my last dime to hold him tonight

i can't remember to forget you
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
tryna run from that, say you done with that
on your face, girl, it just don't show
when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you but i'll lie if i have to
cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost

story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoading me
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
he's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in, because i'm gone again
and to him i just can't be true
and i know that he knows
i'm unfaithful and it
kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying
i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer
i feel it in the air
as i'm doing my hair
preparing for another day
a kiss upon my cheek
as here on refonlicky
as if i'm gonna be out late
i say i won't be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well
cause i know that
he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with
some other guy
i can see him dying
i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

aaaaaye
yellow diamonds in the light
i was standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
what it takes to come alive
it's the way i'm feeling, i just can't deny
but i've gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
shine a light through an open door
love and life i will divide
turn away 'cause i need you more
feel the heartbeat in my mind
it's the way i'm feeling, i just can't deny
but i've gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
yellow diamonds in the light
i was standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
he's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in
because i'm gone again
and to him i just can't be true
and i know that he knows i'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying
i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be
a murderer
i feel it in the air
as i'm doing my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
asks if i'm gonna be out late
i say i won't be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well
cause i know that he knows i'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying
i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be
a murderer
our love, his trust
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head, get it over with
i don't wanna do this
anymore
whoa, oh oh
anymore
i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
and every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
and i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be
a murderer
a murderer

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair

amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you'd still be wastin' days away now had i never saved the day
consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away

could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya areare
so live your life
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life
cause i'm a paper chaser
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life
just livin' my life  my life
my life  my life  just livin' my life
got everybody watchin' what i do, come walk in my shoes
and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
we gon' post up on the top spot
livin the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me
the life, my life

i hate the way this feels
suddenly i'm scared to be apart
the days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe
i wish that you would just put me down
i wish that i could go to sleep
loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
cos i'm standing over the edge
i should let you go
tell myself the things i need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong
that's why i'm loving you when you're not here
feels like i drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between
somehow you got me where it really hurts
it's killing every part of me
loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
boy cos i'm standing over the edge
loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
and i had as much as i can take
and love is a long way down
loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
and i'm way past every moment
but i'm still determined to fight
and i know it's taking all my strength
to keep these emotions alive
loving you is suicide
another day, another reminder
that you're not here with me
i watch the snowflakes falling from the skies
i get lost in memories
the time we try to build a snow man
the time we try to count the stars
it's crazy how we didn't know that
that we'd ever be apart
i can hear the music playing
see the lights upon the tree
i can feel the joy in every soul
but for me it's incomplete
and i try my best to play the part
but no matter what i do
no, it just don't feel like christmas, without you
youuuuuu, you, you no
verse two
another tear, another regret boy
that your so far away
can't believe it was only last year
we shared that christmas day
remember when we took the sleigh ride
remember singing by the fire
there's not too muches in the day light
i keep reliving you and i
breakdown
the time we try to build a snow man
the time we tried to count the stars
it's crazy how we didn't know that
that we'd ever be apart

the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i can't remember to forget you
i go back again, fall off the train
land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
what i'm trying to say is not to forget
you see only the good, selective memory
the way he makes me feel like
the way he makes me feel
i never seemed to act so stupid
oh, here we go
he a part of me now, he a part of me
so where he goes, i follow, follow, follow
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh

but when you look at me
the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
ohohoohohoh, ohohoohohoh
i can't remember to forget you
i rob and i kill to keep him with me

if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
tryna run from that, say you done with that
on your face, girl, it just don't show
when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me

you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you but i'll lie if i have to
cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself

mack, geoff  gottwald, lukasz  walter, henry  dean, ester  harris, calvin
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fucking hates me and i love it, wait
where you going, i'm leaving you, no you ain't
come back, we're running right back here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude?, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now i know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time, there will be no next time, i apologize
even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games
i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i said i'm geeked and i'm fired up

consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away

the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy carars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far

so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop

livin the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew see, but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleeptalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair
call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at
mc's, blood get spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back
in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
straw into gold chump, i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket, face facts
i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothing, i'm still friends with the
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah you think i'm crazy
well, that's not fair
well, that's not fair

i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
i wish today it will rain all day
maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
trying to forgive you for abandoning me
praying but i think i'm still an angel away
angel away, yeah strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got their guns out aiming at me
but i become near when they aiming at me
me, me, me against them
me against enemies, me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start coming and i start rising
must be surprising, i'm just summising
i win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
more fire
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocating everytime it locks me in
paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word, i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly, i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
i came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
i came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
to fly
to fly
get ready for it

what's a life with no fun? please, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
they won't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real

i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to

cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know we know
you hate being alone well you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
to save you instead they say
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself

i'll take care of you

burning fires in this room
it just fits
light and smooth
like my feet in my shoes
little one, lie with me
sew you heart to my sleeve
we'll stay quiet
underneath shooting stars
if it helps you sleep
and hold me tight
don't let me breathe
feeling like
you won't believe
there's a firefly
loose tonight
better catch it
before it burns this place down
and i lie
if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better
through your eyes
there's a firefly
loose tonight
better catch it
before it burns this place down
and i lie
if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better
through your eyes
teach my skin
those new tricks
warm me up
with your lips
heart to heart
melt me down
it's too cold
in this town
close your eyes
lean on me
face to mouth
lips to cheek
feeling numb
in my feet
you're the one
to help me get to sleep
and hold me tight
don't let me breathe
feeling like
you won't believe
there's a firefly
loose tonight
better catch it
before it burns this place down
and i lie
if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better
through your eyes
there's a firefly
loose tonight
better catch it
before it burns this place down
and i lie
if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better
through your eyes
it's only been
one night of love
and maybe
that is not enough
hold me tight

happy days

till you're not feeling sure
everything will brighten up
if we go to brighton
i'll take you along the pier
everything will lighten up and
if you feel too frightened
i'll make things disappear, dear
darling, don't be nervous
i'll understand
if you'll let me go
i did this on purpose
now, cause when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food
and i'll squeeze into a dress
so i can be like you
and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you're leaving too
maybe, i'll put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
sunny days
that left my skin dark red
and you breathe me
till these thoughts leave my head
if it gets too complicated
i'll give up and be frustrated
can you see what's wrong?
if you feel like you've been jaded and
this love's too overrated
see what's going on, on
darling, don't be nervous
i'll understand
if you'll let me go
i did this on purpose
now, cause when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food
and i'll squeeze into a dress

and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you're leaving too
maybe, i'll put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
take me back to live at home
take me back to albert road
cause when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food
and i'll squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you
and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you left me too
i thought i'd put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
and i'll stop eating food
and i squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you
and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you left me too
i thought i'd put you to a test
and say that i love you
now it seems you loved me too

so take a deep breath and let it go
you shouldn't be drowning on your own
and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over

she's like cold coffee in the morning
i'm drunk off last night's whisky and coke
she'll make me shiver without warning
and make me laugh, as if i'm in on joke
and you can stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now
and tell me if i'm wrong
and tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
to help you fall asleep tonight
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love
the way you want me to
i'll wake with coffee in the morning
but she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
outside, the day is up and calling
but i don't have to be
so please go back to sleep
and stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now
and tell me if i'm wrong
and tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
to help you fall asleep tonight

it's alright to cry
even my dad does sometimes
so don't wipe your eyes
tears remind you you're alive
it's alright to die
cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
but just for tonight
hold on
so live life like you're giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart
it's alright to shake
even my hand does sometimes
so inside we rage
against the dying of the lights
it's alright to say
that death's the only thing you haven't tried
but just for today
hold on
so live life like you're giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart
hold on
live life like you're giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart
hold on
she is the sweetest thing that i know
should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
shakes my soul like a pothole every time
took my heart upon a one way trip
guess she went wandering off with it
none like most women i know
this one will bring it back whole
daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
oh my baby, lately i know
that every night i'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
oh we're in love, aren't we?
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby
i feel safe when you're holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
yeahyeah, yeahyeah
she is the river flowin' nowhere
and tin wind chimes used for doorbells
fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
spend my summertime beside her
and the rest of the year the same
she is the flint that sparks the lighter
and the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
all this, all this i know
but every night i'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
oh we're in love, aren't we?
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby
i feel safe when you're holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
yeahyeah, yeahyeah
well, i've found love inside
the arms of the woman i know
she is the lighthouse in the night
that will safely guide me home
and i'm not scared of passing over
or the thought growing old
cause from now until i go
every night i kiss you, you'll say in my ear
oh we're in love, aren't we?
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby
i feel safe when you're holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah
every night i kiss you, you'll say in my ear
oh we're in love, aren't we?
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby

yeah, yeah, yeah
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
the rain won't stop falling
it's harder than before
this car keeps on stalling
pedal to the floor
what i need to know
is if you love me and i really need to know
is if you want me when you call
if you want me when you call
we were young and we were foolish
school books in our arms
dodging homework, dodging classes
to set off fire alarms
and what i need to know
is if you love me and i really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
we are waving
what i need to know
is if you love me and i really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call
across the sea
by the tennessee skyline
they told me i'd find my
hopes and my dreams
but i long to be
in the bed of my true love
back where i came from
she's waiting for me
so i'll make my way
through long winding country roads
but my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
i told my dad
on the phone it's amazing
from the straight to the crazy
these places i've seen
but i long to be
in the arms of my true love
like he loves my mother
he understands me
i'll spend my days
just travelling and playing shows
but my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
i met a man
in the bar down in memphis
and he told me he went there
to follow his dreams
he told me son
you know i lost my true love
for the same exact reason
that you crossed the sea
and i found truth
in people i barely know
but my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
oh my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
oh my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
oh, misty eye of the mountain below
keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
keep watching over durin's sons
if this is to end in fire
then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
calling out father oh
stand by and we will
watch the flames burn on and on
the mountain side
and if we should die tonight
then we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
calling out father oh
prepare as we will
watch the flames burn on and on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
and i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
oh, should my people fall
then surely i'll do the same
confined in mountain halls
we got too close to the flame
calling out father oh
hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
and if the night is burning
i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns
then my brothers will die
and as the sky is falling down
it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground
i hear my people screaming out
now i see fire
inside the mountains
i see fire
burning the trees
i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
i see fire
and i see fire
and i see fire
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
i stole a car last night
don't know where we're gonna go
but go ahead and drive
i will take you home
honey it's cold outside
your jumper is torn now
but darling hold on tight
i will keep you warm
and we will cry till this fire is drowned
and we will write all our memories down
and we will drive till these tires wear out
but darling i, i will take you home
instrumental
if we can drive all night
until the sun is showing up
i see it in your eyes
mmm they will take me home
honey, it's so damn bright
daylight's taking over again
just follow the signs
they will lead us home
and we will cry
til this fire is drowned
and we will write all our memories down
and we will drive till these tires wear out
but darling i, i will take you home
and we will drive 'til our tires wear out
and we will write all our memories down
and we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
but darling, i, i will keep you warm
oh darling, i, i will keep you warm
darling i, i will take you home
la, la, la, la
i met this girl late last year
she said don't you worry if i disappear
i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten
baby, bring the lemon  a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
she's singing
la, la, la, la
don't with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my own
i don't wanna know that, babe
la, la, la
don't with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim  reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
la, la, la
for a couple of weeks i only want to see her
we drink away the days with a take away pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place  loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either
but me  her we make money the same way
four cities, two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
maybe we'll go together  just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you  sit on the couch
but we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissing him how i was confused about
she should figure it out why i'm sat here singing
don't with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my own
i don't wanna know that, babe
don't with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim  reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
on my hotel door!
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told you
trust  respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun  i thought you were different
this is not the way you realize what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late if i'm honest
and all this time god knows i'm singing
don't with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my own
i don't wanna know that, babe
don't with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim  reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
don't with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my own
i don't wanna know that babe
don't with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim  reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
i write this song in memory of
the wayward smile
the boy we won't forget
the soul you took away from us
the river flows
the tears that we wept
missing you
is all that needs to be said
more than blue
the words inside my head
and i know that you're gone
the cheeky smile
of jokes and laughs
the memories of times
we crossed the line
the stepping stones
across my mind
washed away
we all now feel so blind
missing you
is all that needs to be said
more than blue
the words inside my head
and i know that you're gone
goodbye
i didn't mean to break your heart
i was just lonely
and everybody falls apart sometimes
i know you've found another one
but won't you just hold me tonight?
i wish i never called you up
nobody told me
and they don't know, we don't speak anymore
so take a good look at us
and won't you just hold me tonight?
and i would stop trying to fall in love again
and keep it a secret
it never works out anyway
but i am not, anything like i was
cause you were the only one for me
yeah
cause maybe i don't want to lose
a lover and friend in one night
if that's alright
i shouldn't have fcked with your mind
and your life too many times
or maybe i don't want to be lonely
darling you are my only love
behind my truth lies everything you are
i never meant to sleep around
i was just lonely
and you did the same
again, and again, and again
woah, i know
so here's to the both of us
here's to our story tonight
oh i would stop trying to fall in love again
and keep it a secret
it never works out anyway
but i am not, anything like i was
cause you were the only one for me
yeah
cause maybe i don't want to lose
a lover and friend in one night
if that's alright
i shouldn't have fcked with your mind
and your life too many times
or maybe i don't want to be lonely
darling you are my only love
behind my truth lies everything you are
when i see my future
it is with you
we'll get there
and i'll want my children
to be with you
we'll get there
cause maybe i don't want to lose
a lover and friend in one night
if that's alright
i shouldn't have fcked with your mind
and your life too many times
or maybe i don't want to be lonely
darling you are my only love
behind my truth lies everything you are
behind my truth lies everything you are
behind my truth lies everything you are
if this is to end in fire
then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
and if we should die tonight
then we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
calling out father, oh
prepare as we will
watch the flames burn auburn over
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
and i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
oh, should my people fall in
surely i'll do the same
confined in mountain halls
we got too close to the flame
calling out father
hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
and i see fire
hollowing souls
and i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
and if the night is burning
i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns then
my brothers will die
and as the sky is falling down
it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground
i hear my people screaming out
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
and i see fire
hollowing souls
and i see fire
blood in the breeze
i see fire
and i see fire
and i see fire
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care
hi suzanne, but i shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first night, but tonight i am
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
a onenight stand turned a twonight stand
it was come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and
he found out, now she feels deserted and used
cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like holeinthewall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
my name's , my name's
river , river run
call me , call me
river , we'll let the river run
always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey!
fuck can i say? if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one
i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
it's been a while since we were here
been too long my fear is
holding back the memories of your eyes
scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
all that's left is shattered hearts
it's plain enough for us to see that
you've got me
you've got me
we're just friends tangled up in loose ends
i feel it coming around again
let me know where you let your heart go
and i will just pretend
that i have never felt this way
since you i have never felt this way
since you
i feel strange
playing games
it's no fuss
i'm not in love
twisted tunes, a melody of spite
if you give me the words then i might
let go unknown feelings
telling me that i cannot fight
when you speak that shite
let go unknown feelings
telling me that
you've got me
you've got me
we're just friends tangled up in loose ends
i feel it coming around again
let me know where you let your heart go
and i will just pretend
that i have never felt this way
since you i have never felt this way
since you
i feel strange
playing games
it's no fuss
i'm not in love
i lost it in your kiss, your lips,
sweetness, in your smile
your words make me whole
but your scars demand a healer's touch
it's true
i'm glad i'm not you
oh, i'm a mess right now
inside out
searching for a sweet surrender
but this is not the end
i can't work it out
how going through the motions
going through us
and oh i've known it for the longest time
and all of my hopes
all of my own words
are all over written on the signs
but you're on my road
walking me home, home, home, home, home
see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love, no
easy baby maybe i'm a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
and put your faith in my stomach
i messed up this time
late last night
drinking to suppress devotion
with fingers intertwined
i can't shake this feeling now
we're going through the motions
hoping you'd stop
and oh i've only caused you pain
i know but all of my words will always below
of all the love you spoke
when you're on my road
walking me home, home, home, home, home
see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love, no
easy, baby, maybe i'm a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
and put your faith in my stomach
and for how long i love my lover
for how long i love my lover and now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover now, now
for how long i love my lover now, now
for how long, long i love my lover
you are the one, girl
and you know that it's true
i'm feeling younger
every time that i'm alone with you
we were sitting in a parked car
stealing kisses in a front yard
we got questions we should not ask, but
how would you feel
if i told you i loved you
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
so tell me that you love me too
in the summer
as the lilacs bloom
blood flows deeper than a river
every moment that i spend with you
we were sat upon our best friend's roof
i had both of my arms around you
watching the sunrise replace the moon, but
how would you feel
if i told you i loved you
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
so tell me that you love me too
yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
stealing kisses in a front yard
we got questions we should not ask
how would you feel
if i told you i loved you
it's just something that i want to do
i'll be taking my time
spending my life
falling deeper in love with you
tell me that you love me too
tell me that you love me too
tell me that you love me too
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
you so dope, don't overdose
i'm so stoked, i need a toast
we do the most, i'm in the ghost like i'm whippin' a boat
i got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
i'm a call away whenever you need me
i'm in a g5 , come to the aside
i got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
you love it, i love it, too, 'cause you my type
you hold me down and i protect you with my life
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you
like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say
but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
now well, when i was young, we connected
when we were little bit older, both sprung
i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
reputation precedes me and rumors are knee deep
the truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
and you understand the good and bad end up in a song
for all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
for all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july
i've passed days , this end game isn't won
with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say, yeah, but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
hey, big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
i hit you like bang
we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's a truth from my red lips
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
white lips, pale face
breathing in snowflakes
burnt lungs, sour taste
light's gone, day's end
struggling to pay rent
long nights, strange men
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately,
her face seems
slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
cause we're just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
ripped gloves, raincoat
tried to swim and stay afloat
dry house, wet clothes
loose change, bank notes
wearyeyed, dry throat
call girl, no phone
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately,
her face seems
slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
cause we're just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
an angel will die
covered in white
closed eye
and hoping for a better life
this time will fade out tonight
straight down the line
and they say
she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately,
her face seems
slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries
they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
and we're all under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and we don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe we fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
to fly, fly
for angels to fly, to fly, to fly
for angels to die
i'm getting very edgy
cos you're trying to take this from me
and it's something that i wanted so bad
cos you're the definition
of someone who has to ruin
the best thing that i ever had
cos you're a jealous girl
and all i can say is
it's your fault but partially mine
for losing hope
for not treating you right
but that will disappear in time
all i gotta do is pass you by
never say what's wrong
whenever i say why?
standing in the corner
shadowed by the light
to you i seem much smaller
but i know it might be you
how much better could i do
to be myself, not someone else?
i'm losing sleep
i live only for the week
i've grown to ignore you
cos when i seem to bore you
you pretend that you're not interested
your eyes start to twinkle
your smile starts to widen
and i just seem to try and forget
but you pay me no attention
even though i do
but i don't care as long as you're mine
it's happening every time
all i gotta do is pass you by
never say what's wrong
whenever i say why?
standing in the corner
shadowed by the light
to you i seem much smaller
but i know it might be you
how much better could i do
to be myself, not someone else?
i'm losing sleep
i live only for the week
and i'm falling harder now it seems
my slipups haunt me in my dreams
and i can't sleep although i think i can
it's insomnia i think i have
but who cares when i'm not your man?
standing in the corner
shadowed by the light
to you i seem much smaller
but i know it might be you
how much better could i do
to be myself, not someone else?
i'm losing sleep
i live only for the week
we're not
no we're not friends
nor have we ever been
we just try to keep those secrets in a lie
and if they find out, will it all go wrong
and heaven knows no one wants it to
so i could take the back road
but your eyes will lead me straight back home
and if you know me like i know you
you should love me, you should know
friends just sleep in another bed
and friends don't treat me like you do
well i know that there's a limit to everything
but my friends won't love me like you
no, my friends won't love me like you
we're not friends
we could be anything
if we try to keep those secrets safe
no one will find out
if it all went wrong
they'll never know what we've been through
so i could take the back road
but your eyes will lead me straight back home
and if you know me like i know you
you should love me, you should know
that friends just sleep in another bed
and friends don't treat me like you do
well i know that there's a limit to everything
but my friends won't love me like you
no, my friends won't love me like you
but then again, if we're not friends
someone else might love you too
and then again, if we're not friends
there'd be nothing i could do
and that's why friends should sleep in other beds
and friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
and i know that there's a limit to everything
but my friends won't love me like you
no, my friends won't love me like you
oh my friends will never love me like you
smoke alarm went off at 9
i woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
she left a note i'll be back in 5
well, i'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey
i was told to put my job in front of you
but it won't hold me like you do
but i do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush
keep it on the edge, smoking on a rollup
when i see my friends, all they say is hold up
and remember the time
when we were in school listening to grownups
didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what?
you know how to sing
but you don't know anything other than that
so maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way you want to be loved
i never told her that i liked
the way she dances slightly out of time
and pretends she knows the words
to a song she's never heard
but i tell her all the time, hey
i was told to put my job in front of you
but it won't hold me like you do
but i do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush
keep it on the edge, smoking on a rollup
when i see my friends, all they say is hold up
and remember the time
when we were in school listening to grownups
didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what?
you know how to sing
but you don't know anything other than that

like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way

hey
i do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush

and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way you want to be loved
could i wake up next to you
when we're hitting double figures
look into your eyes
like i'm looking into double mirrors
could you make it any clearer
everything's such a blur
it's not my turn
it's hers to get hurt
on a late night
coming home from way too many train rides
lace not as red as my face
i'm home at the same time
highbury estate's fine
smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines
i haven't slept for the past week
two hours ain't enough for me
i feel inspired, at quarter to three, am
i haven't changed since our last meet
i'm still getting all my meals for free
think i'm being shunned by my feet, again
it's not a homeless life for me, it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be and it's not a homeless life for me
and now i'm sitting on a night bus
flicking through my ipod
feeling kinda tired
so i try to close my eyes up
driver, turn the lights off
lights on, on stage, mics on
song plays, nice one
gotta keep my hype strong
truth be, never went to uni
people see right through me
but i'm not a fool see
i'm never gonna do one
gonna live past 22, done
everything i need to
except get a 2 1
i haven't slept for the past week
two hours ain't enough for me
i feel inspired, at quarter to three, am
i haven't changed since our last meet
i'm still getting all my meal's for free
think i'm being shunned by my feet again
it's not a homeless life for me, it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be it's not a homeless life for me
when i feel cold
you keep me warm
and i'm not looking for some loose change
wanna find a true mate
who wants to be my duvet
it's not a homeless life for me, it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be and it's not a homeless life for me, yearh, mh, oh
i've been spinning now for time
couple women by my side
i got sinning on my mind
sipping on red wine
i've been sitting here for ages
ripping out the pages
how'd i get so faded
how'd i get so faded?
oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
if you loved me how'd you never learn
ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
one or two could free my mind
this is how it ends
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
fading out again
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
so tell me when it kicks in
hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
well tell me when it kicks in
hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
i've been looking for a lover
thought i'd find her in a bottle
god, make me another one
i'll be feeling this tomorrow
lord, forgive me for the things i've done
i was never meant to hurt no one
and i saw scars upon a brokenhearted lover
oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
if you loved me how'd you never learn
ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
one or two could free my mind
this is how it ends
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
fading out again
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
so tell me when it kicks in
hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
well tell me when it kicks in
hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
tell me when it kicks in
all the voices in my mind, calling out across the line

he rode through the streets of the city
down from his hill on high
o'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles
he rode to a woman's side
for she was his secret treasure
she was his shame and his bliss
and a chain and a keep are nothing
compared to a woman's kiss
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
and there he stood with sword in hand
the last of derry's ten
and red the grass beneath his feet
and red his banners bright
and red the blow of the setting sun
that bathed him in its light
c'mon c'mon the great lord called
my sword is hungry still
and with the cry of savage rage
they swarmed across the rill
and with the cry of savage rage
they swarmed across the rill
he rode through the streets of the city,
down from his hill on high,
o'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles
he rode to a woman's side,
for she was his secret treasure
she was his shame and his bliss
and a chain and a keep are nothing
compared to a woman's kiss
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
they crawled out of the woodwork
and they whispered into your brain
they set you on the treadmill
and they made you change your name
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
loneliness was tough
the toughest role you ever played
hollywood created a superstar
and pain was the price you paid
even when you died
oh the press still hounded you
all the papers had to say
was that marilyn was found in the nude
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
goodbye norma jean
from the young man in the 22nd row
who sees you as something as more than sexual
more than just our marilyn monroe
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
i wanna be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
and never an excuse i made up
tell you the truth i hate
what didn't kill me,
it never made me stronger at all
love will scar your makeup,
lip sticks to me
so now i maybe lean back there
i'm sat here,
wishing i was sober
i know i'll never hold you like i used to
but a house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold i'll be freezing
can't rely on my heart to beat in
cause you take parts of it every evening
take words out of my mouth just from breathing
replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
should i? should i?
maybe i'll get drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
to feel a little love
i wanna hold your heart in both hands
not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
and i've got no plans for the weekend
so should we speak then?
keep it between friends?
though i know you'll never love me like you used to
there may be other people like us
who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
flames just create us
burns don't heal like before
and you don't hold me anymore
on cold days cold plays out like the band's name
i know i can't heal things with a handshake
you know i can change,
as i began saying
you cut me wide open like landscape
open bottles of beer but never champagne
to applaud you with the sound that my hands make
should i? should i?
maybe i'll get drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
to feel a little love
all by myself
i'm here again
all by myself
you know i'll never change
all by myself
all by myself
i'm just drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
i'll be drunk, again
to feel a little love
oh, maybe i came on too strong
maybe i waited too long
maybe i played my cards wrong
oh, just a little bit wrong
baby i apologize for it
i could fall or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
and jumping in harder than
ten thousand rocks on the lake
so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
you're a mystery
i have traveled the world, there's no other girl like you
no one, what's your history?
do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
cause i heard you do, mmh
i could fall or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
and lie awake, every day
don't know how much i can take
so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
i could fall or i could fly
here in your aeroplane
and i could live, i could die
hanging on the words you say
and i've been known to give my all
sitting back, looking at
every mess that i made
so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
so let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i'm saying hush little baby
don't you cry
daddy ain't sure he can raise you right
i ain't even good with saving my money
why should i think i could save your life
the whole family's gonna think i'm a devil
cah i don't want to see my angels eyes
i say this with one hand on my heart
guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
my thoughts were my worst thoughts
running through my head in circles
the world's gonna hate me for saying this
but patience is a virtue
so we don't have to rush
for our first yute
we could take time do rehearsals
and i ain't acting, this is personal
and i ain't doing this just to hurt you
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
when i'm telling her about raving
she's telling me about cravings
i just want her to get the message
i don't want to have to be so blatant
so i told her my life ain't balanced yeah
so the time ain't right
she said god's clocks the only one that matters
and it's about time i tried
and if i listen to my family
then i'll be a new addition to my family
i can't help feeling peer pressured
everyone's looking down but
they don't understand me
and everyone's so suggestive
i'm getting mixed messages
but nobody's rang me huh
i ain't saying this is a game
but when i say the wrong thing
everybody wants to hang me
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then
take me back to when
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and it's real
when we watched the sunset
over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night
i don't reckon that i did it right
i was younger then,
take me back to when
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and it's real
when we watched the sunset
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way
i still remember these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and it's real
when we watched the sunset
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, baby, i just want to dance
i met her on grafton street right outside of the bar
she shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
she asked me what does it mean, the gaelic ink on your arm?
said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
she took jamie as a chaser, jack for the fun
she got arthur on the table with johnny riding a shotgun
chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
then put van on the jukebox, got up to dance
you know, she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, baby, i just want to dance
with my pretty little galway girl
you're my pretty little galway girl
you know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
and then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
as last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
after dancing to cilidh singing to trad tunes
i never heard carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
a capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
oh, i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
and in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
you know, she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, baby, i just want to dance
my pretty little galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
and now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
i was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
as we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
i walked her home then she took me inside
to finish some doritos and another bottle of wine
i swear i'm gonna put you in a song that i write
about a galway girl and a perfect night
she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, baby, i just want to dance
my pretty little galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl

just want to know if it is me
and you know i've learned from my mistakes
and how much have i got to lose?
you find my heart is hard to break
can't keep playing the fool
breathe in, exhale
to turn to move beyond the pale
flag up, set sail
to find what's there beyond the pale
breathe in, exhale
to turn to move beyond the pale
flag up, set sail
to find what's there beyond the pale
i feel like i've gone to the end of the world
what do i have to do?

can't keep playing the fool
breathe in, exhale

to try and justify
the way you liberate me
every time

when you get home
i'm high as a kite
and i know i'm almost gone
when you get home
so please come home
when i was six years old, i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long
i know i've grown, but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and
getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night
i don't reckon that i did it right, but
i was younger then, take me back to when
we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
oh, how we've grown, but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids, but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by, but
these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way
i still remember these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
your love is the strongest thing i know
i reckon it's been doing weights
eating raw eggs in it's cereal
and running ten miles a day
and your love has a driving ban,
for trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands,
and your love is a friend of mine
so we'll take it care tonight
if you could only say the words
i'd take it and i'd write it down
and hold it deep inside of me
until the day you found me out
but i know your love,
and that's why
i could be your diary,
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world,
just give me the words
and i could be your diary,
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world,
just give me the words
and your love,
has never been my enemy
used to hold me
and promise it would never leave
never been better since all the therapy
to read the words between the lines
and take away my melody
and your love,
told me it was going to a different page
and you know, if i let you go,
i'll still keep you safe
if you could only say the words
i'd take it and i'd write it down
and hold it deep inside of me
until the day you found me out
but i know your love
and that's why
i could be your diary,
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world
just give me the words
and i could be your diary,
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world
just give me the words
you are the one i fall asleep with
but never wake up to
cause work is something you must do
i trust you like you trust me
it must mean true love
it does exactly what it says on the tin
let me begin
you are the one i watch the movies with
for recognizing my love for kiera knightley for what it truly is
just an excuse so i don't have to watch love actually again
but you're actually the same
it's just to spite me
and we eat icecream with fishes in it
until the dishes finished
playing computer games although i know i'll never win it
i tried to make tea once for you in bed
but all i did was spill it
so you made it for me instead
let me in bed
if you get in ahead of me
it's better to do
yeah, love is ahead of the truth
but in love
we are better in two
i'll be the newcomer
stuck in heaven with the devil in you
diary
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world
just give me the words
and i could be your diary,
baby if you open me up
keep it inside me,
i'll give you the world
just give me the words
yeah
you and i
two of a mind
this love's
one of a kind
you and i
we're drifting
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too?
you and i
learning to speak
with kisses on cheeks
you and i
we're lifted
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too?
i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too?
i was born inside a small town, i lost that state of mind
learned to sing inside the lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride
the paving stones i played upon, they kept me on the grind
so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
and when the world's against me is when i really come alive
and everyday that satan tempts me, i try to take it in my stride
you know that i've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun
i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
instead, i look in the mirror questioning what i've become
i guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
without a ninetofive job or an uni degree
to be caught up in the trappings of the industry
show me the locked doors, i find another use for the key
and you'll see
i'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
but with that said give me one more, higher
another one to take the sting away
i am happy on my own, so here i'll stay
save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
i chased the pictured perfect life, i think they painted it wrong
i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run
i beg you, don't be disappointed with the man i've become
our conversations with my father on the a14
age twelve telling me i've gotta chase those dreams
now i'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
with my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
wembley stadium crowd's twohundredandfortythou'
i may have grown up but i hope that damien's proud
and to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
somehow
i'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
but with that said give me one more, higher
another one to take the sting away
oh, i am happy on my own, so here i'll stay
save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
welcome to the new show
i guess you know i've been away
but where i'm heading, who knows
but my heart will stay the same
welcome to the new show
i guess you know i've been away
but where i'm heading, who knows
my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
and i'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
hmm let me go,
to see my family
please father let me go,
as my mother sleeps
i don't know about days gone,
but round here nobody lives twice
when your gone, your gone, without no bye,
because only a judge can give you life
this is my advice,
trust me, i nearly lost my life
3 weeks after i got this rhyme,
it seems like i had too much wine
which that i i didn't get one,
anyway, i was going to the? booked for a set,
even though i didn't have a set one
skream hit the decks, i was like check one
put on a show, but it weren't my best one
left it, dropped off blacks at his destination,
then i was off to the next one,
20 minutes later i was on the m1,
tired
but i kept on going,
fell asleep without even knowing
no motion in my face,
no movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
woke up,
lorry,
flash,
panic,
break,
skid,
crash,
skidded,
more,
bang,
smash,
out,
cold,
ribs,
cracked,
ouch
i was in so much pain,
crawled out of a megan that now looked like a mini,
when i was still on the first lane
baffled, didn't even know my name
fainted, too much shock in my brain
surrounded by paramedics and feds,
trying to get up but fainted again
i just want you to take a second, hear me out
don't think i'm happy cuz i smile when you see me out
i've had serious madnesses where i've nearly disappeared,
oh i'm begging lord to save me and let me go,
to see my family,
and keep it inside,
dry eyes, while my brother weeps
save my soul,
please father let me go
keep me safe, as my mother sleeps
eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
i can hear voices and my phone ringing
fighting for life, can't tell if i'm winning,
one of the worst situations i've been in
i can hear all of the angels singing
but when it stopped humming,
my brain turned on, stared running
still in pain, but it started numbing,
the stone cold comeback i made was stunning
i still tried to do a few shows cuz i didn't wanna tell them that i weren't coming
but i was left with a permanent problem,
nobody knows about the pain that i'm in
ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running
i used the first air kit like a drum set,
picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming
trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
you can't afford to let one in
never done dream for a while,
the black plan was blocked,
so i learnt and done a bit of plumbing
they say tomorrow never dies,
but he forgot to tell you 'you can'
you can have a sicker clan than wutang,
but when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
you can try beg for another,
sometimes i'll be on my way to a show,
thinking 'i just wanna see my brother',
then do a uturn, i'm gone, runner
i just want you to take a second, hear me out
don't think i'm happy cuz i smile when you see me out
i've had serious madnesses where i've nearly disappeared
oh i'm begging lord to save me and let me go,
to see my family
and keep it inside,
dry eyes, while my brother weeps
save my soul
i've been drinking, i've been drinking
i get filthy when that liquor's in me baby
i've been thinking, i've been thinking
why can't i keep my fingers off it, baby? i want you, nana
why can't i keep my fingers off it, baby? i want you, nana
cigars on ice, cigars on ice
feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
flashing lights, flashing lights
you got me faded, faded, faded, baby, i want you, nana
you got me faded, faded, faded, baby, i want you, nana
drunk in love
i want you
we woke up in the kitchen saying
how the hell did this shit happen?

love, love
walking down 29th and park
i saw you in another's arms
only a month we've been apart
you look happier
saw you walk inside a bar
he said something to make you laugh
i saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
yeah, you look happier, you do
ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody love you like i do
promise that i will not take it personal, baby
if you're moving on with someone new
cause baby you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i'll feel it too
and until then i'll smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you
sat on the corner of the room
everything's reminding me of you
nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
aren't you?
ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody need you like i do
i know that there's others that deserve you
but my darling, i am still in love with you
but i guess you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i'll feel it too
i could try to smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you
baby, you look happier, you do
i know one day you'd fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that i'll be waiting here for you
ed sheeran
there must be some kind of way out of here
said the joker to the thief, yeah
there's too much confusion
mmm i can't get no relief
yeah
i see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
you'd find me in the middle if i picked a different life
before my name started tripling in size
but i'm still showing signs
in the pitch black, it's too cold
i'm all alone take me back to the roads
i had to rode to get here and i'll hitch back
get a cab to my mother's house
see my old man and grab a six pack
tell my brother i love him
and give him something that will see him through the hard times
what's a brother for?
when i'm sick of this life i see
it has to be my family who lift me off the floor
make sense of all the madness in a world full of money and
i was a failed man and worse i couldn't give a fuck
save your wine for the entrepreneurs
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
cause your world is the same as mine
pour more blood in your cup
take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
the flavour of an illmannered nature
that lingers on as animals in all of us
trying to fight for the right to live a life
but some will never win though
that's why they live a lie
i don't think i'll ever win
all of this is anything
when i die i hope a brother's at my side
there's no trap door, or get out clause
the world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
you've seen mine, i think it's time i see yours
i bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
some are lost some are
apart from the fact i live my life in the light and now i'm trapped in it
the way i feel within a few years time
i might have a couple kids and just forget i ever wrote this
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
take away the treasure of a man
convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
even though i ain't religious i'm a little superstitious
maybe there is a promised land
but will i make it or not is a different matter
i've been a joker, i've been a thief, i've been a rapper
i've been the only enemy that i can never beat
give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
my mind is a warrior
my heart is a foreigner
my eyes are the color of red like a sunset
i'll never keep it bottled up
and left to the hands of the coroner
be a true heart, not a follower
we're not done yet
and i see it in your movements tonight
if we should ever do this right
i'm never gonna let you down
i'll never let you down
and i'm keeping on the down low
and i'll keep you around so i'll know
that i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings
like you were a grade eight
but i never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down, now
you're strumming on my heart strings
like you were a grade eight
but i never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down, now
my eyes are a river filler
this drink is a liver killer
my chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again
your body is my ballpoint pen
and your mind is my new best friend
your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again, now
and i see it in your movements tonight
if we should ever do this right
i'm never gonna let you down
i'll never let you down
i'll keep it on the down low
and i'll keep you around so i'll know
that i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings
like you were a grade eight
but i never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings
like you were a grade eight
but i never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
and i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now

i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings
like you were a grade eight
but i never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
another day, another life
passes by just like mine
it's not complicated
another mind, another soul
another body to grow old
it's not complicated
do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
and hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and you're miles away
and yesterday you were here with me
another tear, another cry
another place for us to die
it's not complicated
another love that's gone to waste
another light lost from your face
it's complicated
is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
and hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and you're miles away
and yesterday you were here with me
ooh, how i miss you
my symphony played the song that carried you out
and ooh how i miss you
and i miss you and i wish you'd stay
do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
and hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and you're miles away
and yesterday you were here with me
mmmmmmmh, mmmmh
mmmmmmmh, mmmmh
mmmmmmmh, mmmmh
mmmmmmmh, mmmmh
touch down
like a seven four seven
stay out
and we'll live forever now
bibia be ye ye
i lost my shoes last night, i don't know where i put my keys
i was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
i bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all i know
is i got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
he kicked me out and then i walked in the rain
i tell myself in every way i won't be doing this again
and tomorrow's a brand new day
someone told me, always say what's on your mind
and i am only being honest with you, i
i get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
bibia be ye ye
i remember less and less and mostly things that i regret
in my phone are several texts, from girls i've never met
and in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
my heart is breaking at the seams and i'm coming apart now
now things are looking up, i'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
and i'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
looking around for the things that i left on the ground
and say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day
someone told me, always say what's on your mind
and i am only being honest with you, i
i get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
wo nooma
wo nooma maaaa ye
wo nooma
wo nooma maaaa ye

someone told me, always say what's on your mind

they say boys don't cry
but your dad has shed a lot of tears
they say i should be a strong man
but baby, i'm still filled with fear
sometimes i don't know who i am
sometimes i question why i'm here
i just wanna be a good dad
will i be? i have no idea
they say girls shouldn't be tough
and moms should raise their kids at home
but baby, i know that that isn't true
cause your momma's the toughest person i know
i wanna raise you to be like her
and watch you show the world how to do it on your own
i'm still tryna figure out who i am
i don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
i'm gonna be there for your first breath
i don't know if i'll be there for your first step
i can promise you that i'll try to work less
but the tour's routed, and i got this album
put in so many hours, and i just want the outcome
to be something that i can look back and i can be proud of
don't wanna be a dad that's living in facetime
but i've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
i won't spoil you, you can trust that
for your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
had your heart broken? been there, done that
i love you and i can't give you enough of that
get back to community that raised you up
read langston hughes, i suggest a raisin in the sun
listen to sam cooke, a change gon' come
you put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
don't try to change the world, find something that you love
and do it every day
do that for the rest of your life
and eventually, the world will change
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up
i recommend that you read the alchemist
listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
and every day, give your momma a compliment
take your girl to the prom
but don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
slow dance with your woman in your arms
sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
don't wake your mom up
do yoga, learn 'bout karma
find god, but leave the dogma
the quickest way to happiness? learning to be selfless
ask more questions, talk about yourself less
study david bowie, james baldwin and 2pac
watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
wear a helmet, don't be stupid
jaywalk, but look before you do it
if it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
take risks, cause life moves so fast
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know, but who am i if
i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up, ooh
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up
it's just another night
and i'm staring at the moon
i saw a shooting star
and thought of you
i sang a lullaby
by the waterside and knew
if you were here
i'd sing to you
you're on the other side
as the skyline splits in two
i'm miles away from seeing you
i can see the stars
from america?
i wonder, do you see them, too?
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home
i can hear your heart
on the radio beat
they're playing 'chasing cars'
and i thought of us
back to the time
you were lying next to me
i looked across and fell in love
so i took your hand
back through lamplit streets and knew
everything led back to you
so can you see the stars
over amsterdam?
you're the song my heart is beating to
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home
and oh
and oh
and oh
i can see the stars
from america
things were all good yesterday
and then the devil took your memory
and if you fell to your death today
i hope that heaven is your resting place
i heard the doctors put your chest in pain
but then that could have been the medicine
and now you're lying in the bed again
either way i'll cry with the rest of them
my father told me, son
it's not his fault he doesn't know your face
you're not the only one
although my grandma used to say
he used to sing
darlin' hold me in your arms
the way you did last night
and we'll die inside
for a little while here oh
i could look into your eyes
until the sun comes up
and we're wrapped in light and life and love
put your open lips on mine
and slowly let them shut
for they're designed to be together oh
with your body next to mine
our hearts will beat as one
and we set alight
we're afire love
love, love
things were all good yesterday
then the devil took your breath away
now we're left here in the pain
black suit black tie standing in the rain
and now my family is one again
stapled together with the strangers and a friend
came to my mind i should paint it with a pen
six years old i remember when
my father told me, son
it's not his fault he doesn't know your face
you're not the only one
although my grandma used to say
he used to sing
darlin' hold me in your arms
the way you did last night
and we'll die inside
for a little while here oh
i could look into your eyes
until the sun comes up
and we're wrapped in light and life and love
put your open lips on mine
and slowly let them shut
for they're designed to be together oh
with your body next to mine
our hearts will beat as one
and we're set alight
we're afire love
love, love
see the love, the love, the love, the love
see the love, the love, the love, the love
see the love, the love, the love, the love
my father and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
and my mother and all of my family
rise from their seats to say hallelujah
and my brother and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
my father and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing
hallelujah
to the love, the love, the love, the love
to the love, the love, the love, the love
to the love, the love, the love, the love
when i was six years old, i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long
i know i've grown, but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and
getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night
i don't reckon that i did it right, but
i was younger then, take me back to when
we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
oh, how we've grown, but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids, but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by, but
these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way
i still remember these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
oh baby, baby
how was i supposed to know
that something wasn't right here?
oh baby, baby
i shouldn't have let you go
cause now you're out of sight, yeah
show me how you want it to be
tell me, baby, 'cause i need to know now, oh, because
my loneliness is killing me, and i
i must confess i still believe, still believe
when i'm not with you, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
oh baby, baby
the reason i breathe is you
yeah, you got me stranded
oh, pretty baby
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
it's not the way i planned it
show me how you want it to be
oh, tell me, babe, 'cause i need to know now, oh, because
my loneliness is killing me, and i
i must confess i still believe, still believe
when i'm not with you, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
oh baby, baby, how was i supposed to know?
oh, pretty baby, i shouldn't've let you go
oh, i must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
hit me baby one more time
my loneliness is killing me, and i
i must confess i still believe, still believe
when you're not with me, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
when i'm not with you, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
i took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
i threw the day old tea from the cup
packed up the photo album matthew had made
memories of a life that's been loved
took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
poured the old ginger beer down the sink
dad always told me, don't you cry when you're down
but mum, there's a tear every time that i blink
oh i'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but i know
a heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back we'll say hallelujah
you're home
fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face
i hope that i see the world as you did 'cause i know
a life with love is a life that's been lived
so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back we'll say hallelujah
you're home
hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
you got to see the person i have become
spread your wings and i know
that when god took you back he said hallelujah
you're home
take me with you i do declare
i love you dearly through here and there
what can i do to make you share?
what can i do to make you care?
the world is harsh
i'm stuck in the dark
i'll make my mark
i've got my spark
we'd be together through bad or worse
sending letters we shall converse
we could do better but we must first
make amends
that depends
will you be my friend?
the world is harsh
i'm stuck in the dark
i'll make my mark
i've got my spark
i was twentyfour years old
when i met the woman i would call my own
twentytwo grand kids now growing old
in that house that your brother bought ya
oh the summer day when i proposed
i made that wedding ring from dentist gold
and i asked her father, but her daddy said, no
you can't marry my daughter
she and i went on the run
don't care about religion
i'm gonna marry the woman i love
down by the wexford border
she was nancy mulligan
and i was william sheeran
she took my name and then we were one
down by the wexford border

she's reinventing loving me
when we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
it must have been about 501
like my blue ripped jeans
and my eyes are closed
and i'm way too tired
hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
on the sofa, where we lay
i wanna stay inside all day
and it's cold outside, again
and we're both so high
we could fly to berlin, tokyo or jamaica
we can go where you want
say the word and i'll take ya
but i'd rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa, with you
when the morning comes
we're not watching formula i
it's not what we breathe for
so kick off the day with friends on t4
two, boiled and brew
two sugars ain't too sweet for you
on the sofa, where we lay
i wanna stay inside all day
and it's cold outside, again
and we're still so high
we could fly to berlin, tokyo or jamaica
we can go where you want
say the word and i'll take ya
but i'd rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa, with you
and it feels like i'm flying
and it feels like
we could go to berlin, tokyo or jamaica
through the streets of new york
that is where i will take ya
paris, rome, to rio
passing through las vegas
we can go where you want
say the word, and i'll take ya
but i'd rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa
on the sofa, with you
loving can hurt
loving can hurt sometimes
but it's the only thing
that i know
and when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive
we keep this love in a photograph
we make these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts are never broken
and time's forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket
of your ripped jeans
holdin' me closer
till our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone
and if you hurt me
well that's okay baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i won't ever let you go
wait for me to come home
loving can heal
loving can mend your soul
and is the only thing
that i know
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
oh you can fit me
inside the necklace you got when you were 16
next to your heartbeat
where i should be
keep it deep within your soul
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
when i'm away
i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost
back on 6th street
hearing you whisper through the phone
wait for me to come home
i found a love for me
darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, i found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all i own
and in your eyes you're holding mine
baby, i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
when you said you looked a mess, i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
well i found a woman, stronger than anyone i know
she shares my dreams, i hope that someday i'll share her home
i found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love, to carry children of our own
we are still kids, but we're so in love
fighting against all odds
i know we'll be alright this time
darling, just hold my hand
be my girl, i'll be your man
i see my future in your eyes
baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
when you saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
i don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot in the grass, listening to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect, no i don't deserve this
you look perfect tonight
shock, horror, i'm down
lost, you're not around
there's a lump in my chest
that sends cold through my head
and my mind shuts sound out
i'm on autopilot
and my tongue's gone silent
just switch it off and lay it down
lay it down next to me
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe when i made you mine
whoaohohoh
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe it was every time
that you said, you said, you said
that i miss you
and i miss you
these words mean nothing to me
i'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
these three words are aching
constrict them, suffocating
my mind is racing
with the picture i'm painting
and my belly's sick to its stomach
when i remember all the times it was with you when you laid it down
you lay down next to me
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe when i made you mine
whoaohohoh
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe it was every time
that you said, you said, you said
that i miss you
more than i let on
i kissed you
far too long
i'll let go as soon as you do
see i know we're not through
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe when i made you mine
whoaohohoh
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe it was every time
that you said, you said, you said
that i miss you, that i miss you
whoaohohoh
i don't know when i lost my mind
maybe it was every time
that you said, you said, you said
that i miss you
ed sheeran
there must be some kind of way out of here
said the joker to the thief, yeah
there's too much confusion
mmm i can't get no relief
yeah
i see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
you'd find me in the middle if i picked a different life
before my name started tripling in size
but i'm still showing signs
in the pitch black, it's too cold
i'm all alone take me back to the roads
i had to rode to get here and i'll hitch back
get a cab to my mother's house
see my old man and grab a six pack
tell my brother i love him
and give him something that will see him through the hard times
what's a brother for?
when i'm sick of this life i see
it has to be my family who lift me off the floor
make sense of all the madness in a world full of money and
i was a failed man and worse i couldn't give a fuck
save your wine for the entrepreneurs
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
cause your world is the same as mine
pour more blood in your cup
take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
the flavour of an illmannered nature
that lingers on as animals in all of us
trying to fight for the right to live a life
but some will never win though
that's why they live a lie
i don't think i'll ever win
all of this is anything
when i die i hope a brother's at my side
there's no trap door, or get out clause
the world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
you've seen mine, i think it's time i see yours
i bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
some are lost some are
apart from the fact i live my life in the light and now i'm trapped in it
the way i feel within a few years time
i might have a couple kids and just forget i ever wrote this
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
take away the treasure of a man
convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
even though i ain't religious i'm a little superstitious
maybe there is a promised land
but will i make it or not is a different matter
i've been a joker, i've been a thief, i've been a rapper
i've been the only enemy that i can never beat
give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance

sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
oh wow, i said
sara, what you do is make my soul unwind
hey now
cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
half the guys i know are after you
cheer me up when i'm in a mood
so i thought i'd write a song for you
and may i say, you look like an angel today
may i say, take me to the place where your mind lays
if only to make you smile today
cos you are great, i thought i'd say that
sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
behind a can of strongbow
oh wow, i said
sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
even with that soul
your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
half the guys i know are after you
cheer me up when i'm in a mood
so i thought i'd write a song for you
and may i say, you look like an angel today
may i say, take me to the place where your mind lays
if only to make you smile today
cos you are great, i thought i'd say that
may i say, you look great
may i play this to make your day
of all the money that e'er i had, i've spent it in good company
and all the harm that e'er i've done, alas, it was to none but me
and all i've done for want of wit, to memory now i can't recall
so fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all
of all the comrades that e'er i had, they are sorry for my going away
and all the sweethearts that e'er i had, they would wish me one more day to stay
but since it falls unto my lord that i should rise and you should not
i'll gently rise and i'll softly call
good night and joy be with you all
a man may drink and not be drunk, a man may fight and not be slain
a man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again
but since it has so ordered been by a time to rise and a time to fall
come fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all
come fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all
tell me that you'd turn down the man
who askes for your hand
cause you're waiting for me
and i know
you're gonna be away a while
but i've got no plans at all to leave
would you take away my hopes and dreams
and just stay with me?
all my senses come to life
while i'm stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and i'll never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me, you'll never leave again
cause you are the only one
take my hand and my
heart and soul, i will
only have these eyes for you
and you know,
everything changes but
we'll be strangers if we see this through
we could stay within these walls and bleed
or just stay with me?
all my senses come to life
while i'm stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and i'll never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me, you'll always be a friend
cause you are the only one
stumbling half drunk
getting myself lost
i am so gone
so tell me the way home
i listen to sad songs
singing about love
and where it goes wrong
all my senses come to life
while i'm stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and i'll never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me, you'll always be a friend
cause you are the only one
can't get you off my mind
look at me and you will find
time after time it seems
i'll say what i don't mean
in your world we were the same
in mine now you're the one to blame
you can't remember my name
we're lost, it's such a shame
listen to me
stop making me see
what i've been waiting for
listen to me
stop making me see
i'm strong yet proud
i'm quiet yet loud
and i'm everything
you want in me
i'm small yet tall
i have it all
and i'm everything
you want me to be
listen to me
stop making me see
what i've been waiting for

and i still feel like
i need you still

and i'm so frustrated, so dilated
and she's telling me i've wasted my time
and i'm running back like, just to face the facts right
to tell me your voice takes me through the night
your smile and your memory
simply eases me to sleep
in my ear while the whispering
melts my heart on every beat

the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance, and now i'm singing like
girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say, boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now, follow my lead
come, come on now, follow my lead
i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bedsheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body

every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you

i've gotta tell you, i'm in love with your shape
you said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
and you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
you got that sweet, sweet loving, i'm a sucker for cake
i know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
i ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
and you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
and when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
we can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
and i've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
you got me looking at your shape, man, i've already won
tryna come and kill the game like my brother teddy done
i ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
let me multiply your lovin', then i hit you with divide, check it
i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bedsheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body

dry your eyes
i'm sick of all your lies
i've grown to despise you
already sick of what you're saying
hoping now i'm only praying
my baby's gone away
and i've already packed my bags
you didn't know me
you couldn't show me
my one and only
has gone away
far away
you'll never leave me alone
now i'm off on my own
i'll never ring your phone again
and still you keep on crying
if i said i loved you
i'd be lying
you need to dry your eyes
and i've still gone to pack my bags
you didn't know me
you couldn't show me
my one and only
has gone away
you didn't know me
you couldn't show me
my one and only
has gone away
far away
everybody gets high sometimes, you know
what else can we do when we're feeling low?
so take a deep breath and let it go
you shouldn't be drowning on your own
and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
it's how we learn and how we grow
and i wanna lay with you 'til i'm old
you shouldn't be fighting on your own
and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
come on, come on
save me from my rocking boat
i just wanna stay afloat
i'm all alone
and i hope, i hope someone come and take me home
somewhere i can rest my soul
i need to know you won't let go
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i won't let go
when the sins of my father
weigh down in my soul
and the pain of my mother
will not let me go
well i know there can come fire from the sky
to refine the purest of kings
and even though
i know this fire brings me pain
even so
and just the same
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
oh, make it rain
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
make it rain
oh, the seed needs the water
before it grows out of the ground
but it just keeps on getting hotter
and the hunger more profound
well i know there can come tears from the eye
but they may as well all be in vain
and even though
i know these tears come with pain
even so
and just the same
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
oh, make it rain
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
just make it rain
make it rain
oh, the seas are full of water
that stops by the shore
just like the riches of grandeur
oh, no no
never reach the poor
and let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
and let lightning be the veins
and fill the sky, with all that they can draw
when it's time to make a change
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
oh, make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
oh, make it rain
make it rain
make it rain down, lord
make it rain
oh, make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
make it rain
oh, make it rain
you're just a small bump unborn
in four months you're brought to life
might be left with my hair
but you'll have your mother's eyes
i'll hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as i can
but for now you're a scan on my unmade plans
a small bump, in four months you're brought to life
and i'll whisper quietly
and give you nothing but truth
if you're not inside me
i'll put my future in you
you are my one, and only
and you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one, and only
you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
and you'll be alright
you're just a small bump
i know you'll grow into your skin
with a smile like hers
and a dimple beneath the chin
fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
a small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes
and i'll hold you tightly
and tell you nothing but truth
if you're not inside me
i'll put my future in you
you are my one, and only
and you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
oh you are my one, and only
you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
and you'll be alright
then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
when you're half asleep, i'll leave you be
right in front of me for a couple weeks
so i can keep you safe
cause you are my one, and only
you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
oh you are my one, and only
you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight
and you'll be alright
cause you were just a small bump unborn, for four months then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why
i gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
i gave away my money and now we don't even speak
i drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
oh, honestly?
offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
they gave me the heartache and in return i gave a song
it goes on and on
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
my farewell
so before i save someone else, i've got to save myself
i gave you all my energy and i took away your pain
cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream
what line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same?
and only scars remain
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
my farewell
so before i save someone else, i've got to save myself
but if don't
then i'll go back
to where i'm rescuing a stranger
just because they needed saving just like that
oh, i'm here again
between the devil and the danger
but i guess it's just my nature
my dad was wrong
cause i'm not like my mum
cause she'd just smile and i'm complaining in a song
but it helps
so before i save someone else
i've got to save myself
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
my farewell
so before i save someone else, i've got to save myself
and before i blame someone else, i've got to save myself
and before i love someone else, i've got to love myself
five drinks in on friday night
we only came to dry your eyes
and get you out of your room
now this bar has closed it's doors
i found my hand is holding yours
do you wanna go home so soon?
or maybe we should take a ride through the night
and sing along to every song that's on the radio
in the back of a taxi cab in brooklyn
oh no no, the sun could rise
burning all the street lamps out at 3am
so dj, play it again
until the night turns into morning
you'll be in my arms
we'll just keep driving
along the boulevard
and if i kissed you, darling
please don't be alarmed
it's just the start
of everything if you want
a new love
in new york
yesterday, you gave me a call
stressing out about it all
said the world is moving too fast
and you don't know where to begin
cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
only to wind up on the other side
by yourself
and every day
screaming out
to all the people that you used to know
from a window that looks upon the manhattan skyline
it's just the way that life goes
and you live it in every song you know
so dj, play it again
until the night turns into morning
you'll be in my arms
we'll just keep driving
along the boulevard
and if i kissed you, darling
please don't be alarmed
it's just the start
of everything if you want
a new life
in new york
and every song that plays
is just like the day you had
and it's okay to cry
but i'm saying maybe that's
a waste of water
you know i'm here for you
in the back of the taxi cab tonight
in new york
it's just reached the morning
and you're still in my arms
and we've stopped driving
down the boulevard
and i just kissed you, darling
i hope you weren't alarmed
it's just the start
of everything that you want
a new love
in new york
well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
she's got that street flow, i still wanna hit it slow
she's got that heat on hold, bend the weed i smoke
know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
i tell her, oohah, oohah, oohah, oohah
said she twerkin' for tuition, gon' do that, do that to that 2pac, 2pac
now she don't wanna leave, i'm the one she wanna be wit'
i told her, go 'head, do that carousel on the dick
she say her pussy sweet like caramel, oh, shit
let me taste that, face where your waist at
bad boy in the pussy, i'm a bring mae back
horse and carriage, diddy, what it take?
that movie on the 6s, know i gotta tape that
rich nigga shit, ririch nigga shit
stop playin' wit' them lames, be a rich nigga bitch
tom ford denim, see the grip when i sit
that boy spit venom, make a nun turn tricks
no teeth, just tongue and some lips wit' the shit
mustard on the beat, but it's some ritz in this bitch
well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
she's got that street flow, i still wanna hit it slow
she's got that heat on hold, bend the weed i smoke
know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
she's got that street flow, i still wanna hit it slow
she's got that heat on hold, bend the weed i smoke
know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
i met you when i was a teen
but then you were one as well
and i could play a guitar
just like ringing a bell
sometimes i wonder,
in any other summer
could you be a part time lover to me
listening to stevie wonder?
under the covers where we used to lay
and re stacks is what the speakers played
i'd be on tour almost every day
when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed
getting high as two kites when we needed to breath
we'd use each other's air just for the people to see
and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
we'd go anywhere our minds would take us
and i'd say you were beautiful without your make up
and you don't need even to worry about your weight cause
we can all be loved the way that god made us
and time's the only reason that we could break up
cause you would always tell me i was away too much
distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
so say it again
oh nina, you should go nina
cause i ain't ever coming home nina
oh won't you leave me now?
and i've been living on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause that's you and me both nina
oh won't you leave me now?
and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone
watching blue planet, creating new habits
acting as if we was two rabbits
and then you'd vanish
back to the burrow with all the celtics
i'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
i understand but i can't help
i put my job over everything except my family and friends
but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back
overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
and i'm not saying we should be taking a break
just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
so we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane
but in a day we'd have to say it again
oh nina, you should go nina
cause i ain't ever coming home nina
oh won't you leave me now?
and i've been living on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause that's you and me both nina
oh won't you leave me now?
love will come and love will go
but you can't make it on your own
sing that song
go oh won't you leave me now?
people grow and fall apart
but you can't mend your broken heart
take it back
go oh won't you leave me now?
ooh
oh nina, you should go nina
cause i ain't ever coming home nina
oh won't you leave me now?
and i've been living on the road nina, oh
but then again you should know nina
cause that's you and me both nina
oh won't you leave me now?
now?
oh nina, you should go nina
cause i ain't ever coming home nina
oh won't you leave me now?
and i've been living on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause that's you and me both nina
oh won't you leave me now?
now?
i seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
jetlagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
cause i heard that time waits for nobody, i suppose it's true
we make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
to see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme
so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
cause real will recognise real is what my father says
and i'll be sticking to this phrase until i pass away
overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
but i'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
5 o'clock with lights off
interview with a vampire
sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require
i swear i said, that i'll sleep when i'm dead
who's on the beat upon the feature with ed, it's dev to the z
overtired, palefaced like michael myers
bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
and over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
cause i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
it's time to wage war
scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
i'm haling from the essex and the east london boarder line
villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
be wide awake just like your snorting lines
or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of jesus walking by
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
the times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be
the times i'm living in lately
i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth
and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
deliver the raps how i flow
i live with the raps now and those that hate me call me ron
but they won't slytherin too easy, believe me i'm snape minded
be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that i'm in
it's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with silocon
i'm still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
opposite of sober cause i never did my homework
which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
await death, take deep breaths, try to never die
never die
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
and if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
times elapsing while your catching z's, the masses like to move
we scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do,
driven young gentlemen
i've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causei haven't slept in them, true!
i'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so i'm correcting 'em
we got the fans all like 'oh wow it's devs and ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got,
i keep my pupils engaged,
like a classroom in holy matrimony but i'm only trying to stay awake
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
the times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be the times i'm living in lately
it's late in the evening
glass on the side
i've been sat with you
for most of the night
ignoring everybody here
we wish they would disappear
so maybe we could get down now
and i don't wanna know
if you're getting ahead of the programme
i want you to be mine, lady
and to hold your body close
take another step into the noman's land
for the longest time, lady
i need you, darling
come on, set the tone
if you feel you're falling
won't you let me know?
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
if you love me
come on, get involved
feel it rushing through you
from your head to toe
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
sing!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
louder!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
sing!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
this love is ablaze
i saw flames from the side of the stage
and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
until then, we got nothing to say
and nothing to know
but something to drink and maybe something to smoke
let it go until our roads are changed
singing we found love in a local rave, no
i don't really know what i'm supposed to say
but i can just figure it out and then hope and pray
i told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya
then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
i already know she's a keeper
just from this one small act of kindness
i'm in deep if anybody finds out
i'm meant to drive home but i've drunk all of it now
not sobering up we just sit on the couch
one thing led to another
now she's kissing my mouth
i need you, darling
come on, set the tone
if you feel you're falling
won't you let me know?
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
if you love me
come on, get involved
feel it rushing through you
from your head to toe
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
oh oh ohoh oh ohoh
sing!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
louder!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
sing!
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
can you feel it?
all the guys in here don't even wanna dance
can you feel it?
all that i can hear is music from the back
can you feel it?
i found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling?
before the beat kicks in again
can you feel it?
can you feel it?
sing!
i need you, darling
come on set the tone
if you feel you're falling
won't you let me know?
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
if you love me
come on, get involved
feel it rushing through you
from your head to toe
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh oh
sing!
i found a love
for me
oh darling, just dive right in
and follow my lead
well, i found a girl
beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone
waitin' for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowin' what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow
your heart is all i own
and in your eyes, you're holding mine
baby, i'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess
i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it
darling, you look perfect tonight
well, i found a man
stronger than anyone i know
he shares my dreams
i hope that someday we'll share a home
i found a love
to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love, to carry children
of our own
we are still kids, but we're so in love
fightin' against all odds
i know we'll be alright this time
darling, just hold my hand
be your girl, you'll be my man
and i see my future in your eyes
well baby, i'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
while listening to our favorite song
when i saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
i don't deserve this
darling, you look perfect tonight
baby, i'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
while listenin' to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel
in person
and she looks perfect
and he looks perfect
no i don't deserve this
you look perfect tonight
i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow
i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
you'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
i never want to get bitten
cause plagiarism is hidden
watch how i sit on the rhythm
prisoner with a vision
signed to a label
but didn't listen to any criticism
thought you knew but you didn't
so perk your ears up and listen
studio is the system
and you could say that i'm driven
and now it's onto the next saga
we drink the best lager
i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
i do my own thing now
and get respect after
and i'm avoiding the 'caine
like it was get carter
for four years i never had a place to stay
but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
like a paper weight
at 16 years old yeah i moved out of my home
i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked
went from sleeping at a subway station
to sleeping with a movie star
and adding to the population
not my imagination
i don't wanna relax
would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax?
i take it back now
mmmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
don't you fade into the back love
no
i take it back with the rhythm and blues
with my rap pack i'll be singing the news
tryin' act like jack black
when i bring it to school
i make a beat with my feet
by just hittin' the loop
bringing the lyrics to prove
that i can fit in these shoes
i give you the truth through the vocal booth
and stars burst out on the scene
like an opal fruit
they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot
but then again that's what they're supposed to do
and i'm supposed to be calm
i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
whispering everything that happens
is from now on
i'll be ready to start again
by the end of the song
since they are claiming i handled it wrong
but then i've never had an enemy
except the nme but i'll be selling
twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
with only spectacles ahead of me
and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree
singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i have it
this song's from the heart cover the planet
i take it back now
mmmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
don't you fade into the back love
no
and take it back now
now i don't ever wanna be perfect
cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
and i accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
putting on a brave face like timothy dalton
considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
now absence can make your heart ache
but drinking absinth can change your mind state
vividly need to let my liver be
and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
and i hope to see him blowing up globally
cause that how it's supposed to be
i'm screaming out vocally
it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
but, but i just write schemes
i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
madison square garden is where i might be
but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
it's time to take it back now
mmmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
don't you fade into the back love
no
mmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
don't you fade into the back love
no
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i'm saying hush little baby
don't you cry
daddy ain't sure he can raise you right
i ain't even good with saving my money
why should i think i could save your life
the whole family's gonna think i'm a devil
cah i don't want to see my angels eyes
i say this with one hand on my heart
guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
my thoughts were my worst thoughts
running through my head in circles
the world's gonna hate me for saying this
but patience is a virtue
so we don't have to rush
for our first yute
we could take time do rehearsals
and i ain't acting, this is personal
and i ain't doing this just to hurt you
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
when i'm telling her about raving
she's telling me about cravings
i just want her to get the message
i don't want to have to be so blatant
so i told her my life ain't balanced yeah
so the time ain't right
she said god's clocks the only one that matters
and it's about time i tried
and if i listen to my family
then i'll be a new addition to my family
i can't help feeling peer pressured
everyone's looking down but
they don't understand me
and everyone's so suggestive
i'm getting mixed messages
but nobody's rang me huh
i ain't saying this is a game
but when i say the wrong thing
everybody wants to hang me
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
i found a love for me
oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, i found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was, i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all i own
and in your eyes, you're holding mine
baby, i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess, i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
sei la mia donna, la forza delle onde del mare
cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti e molto di pi
spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
e siamo sempre bambini ma nulla  impossibile
stavolta non ti lascer
mi baci piano ed io torno ad esistere
e nel tuo sguardo crescer
ballo con te, nell'oscurit, stretti forte poi
a piedi nudi noi, dentro la nostra musica
ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto
tu stasera, vedi, sei perfetta per me
ballo con te, nell'oscurit, stretti forte poi
a piedi nudi noi, dentro la nostra musica
ho creduto sempre in noi
perch sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
quanto ti ho aspettato
perch tu stasera sei perfetta per me
just give me a pen and i'll write my worries
now and again i'll try and not see that you don't care
taking the time to taste and savour
life's bitter wine and childish behaviour
but you don't care
and hey, i don't speak that language of youth
and hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
and hey, i lay in this world for a while
when all is lost just smile
see all the fakes that look so hollow
but you don't care
what ever happened to the youth and culture?
wear chains and the same fecking lonsdale jumper
so you don't care
and hey, i don't speak that language of youth
and hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
and hey, i lay in this world for a while
when all is lost just smile
i found a love for me
oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, i found a girl beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was, i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all i own
and in your eyes, you're holding mine
baby, i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
when you said you looked a mess, i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
well, i found a man stronger than anyone i know
he shares my dreams, i hope that someday we'll share a home
i found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love, to carry children of our own
we are still kids, but we're so in love
fighting against all odds, i know we'll be alright this time
darling, just hold my hand, be your girl, you'll be my man
and i see my future in your eyes
well baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
when i saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
i don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see, now i know i have met
an angel in person, and she looks perfect
no, i don't deserve it, you look perfect tonight
now it seems i've been young, dug my hole in the ground
to me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down
however hard i try, i only get weaker
seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
what you gotta do is never get yourself down
bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure
seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
move on, forget it
now move on, forget it
when i first started this rapping shit i felt pressure from haters
became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
and made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
and then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block
who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
i'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
with my head in the sky
ed sheeran, urban angel coming ready to die
so see the signs, stand to the side
open your eyes and take a look and realise
the resurrection's arrived
and as the mist clears, homie i arise
from my tomb in disguise
i'm all alone, alonestar
urban angel rising from the ashes
surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
now back up!
move on, forget it
now move on, forget it
all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it
not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
who did it, who is it, who's in it, who what the fuck does it matter?
chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
it don't matter to me
all i want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
to be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
yeah, yeah, can you hear me?
lying in a bedroom
lighting up a benson
face hair is growing
so i cut with a vengeance
hey, did i mention
as she makes an entrance
said i had a tendency
to finish off a sentence
oh well, she's a local girl
no makeup 'cause she knows me well
hair tied up in elastic band
with a kiss on the cheek
for her onenight man
is it fast food
i'll regret it after?
and i needed money
but i'm too shy to ask her
so she buys me chips and cheese
and i tell her i love her
and she's all i need
i take it with a cold glass
of the fruit and the barley
she's still a sucker
for the apple and bacardi
heading to the party
sitting in the car seat
bep on radio
it makes me feel naughty
she knows me well
bit of a catch to have a local girl
hair tied up in elastic band
with a kiss on the cheek
for her onenight man
i don't wanna go alone
i don't wanna go alone
i don't wanna go alone
tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks
the color of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she's more than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her
more than anyone else
if you don't, i'll tell her myself
and we've got love in us
so if the drink kill us
we're gonna dance all night
til the floor fillers
if we talk outside
i say i hate wasps too
i don't really dance
so i'll just watch you
are you taking me back tonight?
tell me if that's alright
i don't wanna be here
i'm not the sofa type
tell me if you have a toothbrush
you don't mind sharing
she said i wanna take off
what you're wearing
i don't wanna go alone
i don't wanna go alone
i don't wanna go alone
tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks
the color of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her
more than anyone else
if you don't, i'll tell her myself
she's like the fast food
i'll regret it after
and i needed money
but i'm too shy to ask her
but she buys me chips and cheese
so i tell her that she's all i need
tell her that i
tell her that i
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks
the color of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i
tell her that i
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her
more than anyone else
if you don't, i'll tell her myself
tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks
the color of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she's more
than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her
more than anyone else
if you don't, i'll tell her myself
loving can hurt
loving can hurt sometimes
but it's the only thing
that i know
and when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive
we keep this love in a photograph
we make these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts are never broken
and time's forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket
of your ripped jeans
holdin' me closer
till our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone
wait for me to come home
loving can heal
loving can mend your soul
and is the only thing
that i know
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
we keep this love in a photograph
we make these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
our hearts were never broken
and time's forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket
of your ripped jeans
holdin' me closer
till our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone
and if you hurt me
well that's okay baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i won't ever let you go
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
oh you can fit me
inside the necklace you got when you were 16
next to your heartbeat
where i should be
keep it deep within your soul
and if you hurt me
well that's okay baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i won't ever let you go
when i'm away
i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost
back on 6th street
hearing you whisper through the phone
wait for me to come home
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care
hi suzanne, but i shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first night, but tonight i am
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
a onenight stand turned a twonight stand
it was come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and
he found out, now she feels deserted and used
cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like holeinthewall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
my name's , my name's
river , river run
call me , call me
river , we'll let the river run
always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey!
fuck can i say? if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one
i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
you look so wonderful in your dress
i love your hair like that
the way it falls on the side of your neck
down your shoulders and back
we are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much
you got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
you look so beautiful in this light
you silhouette over me
the way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the tenerife sea
and all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath
just say the word and i will disappear into the wilderness
should this be the last thing i see

you looked so wonderful in your dress
i loved your hair like that
and in the moment i knew you beth
i've known it for a long time
daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
disappearing all night
i don't wanna know where he's been lying
i know what i wanna do
i wanna runaway
runaway with you
gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go
how long you leaving?
well dad just don't expect me back this evening
oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
it's been a long day
thumb on side of the roadway, but
i love him from the skin to my bones
but i don't wanna live in his home
there's nothing to say 'cause he knows
i'll just runaway and be on my own
i've never seen my dad cry
cold as stone, in the kitchen light
i tell you it's about time
but i was raised to keep quiet
and this is what i'm gonna do
gonna runaway, gonna make that move
gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go
how long you leaving?
well dad just don't expect me back this evening
oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
it's been a long day
thumb on side of the roadway, but
i love him from the skin to my bones
but i don't wanna live in his home
there's nothing to say and he knows
i'll just runaway and be on my own
back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
cause i packed my closet
my dad was a man without plans
but taking turns to show love
i don't wanna live this way
gonna take my things and go
if things change in a matter of days
could be persuaded to hold up
and mama was the same
none of us are saints
i guess that god knows that
i don't wanna runaway
and one of these days i might just show that
put my home in a suitcase
tie both showlaces, and hope that
things change, but for now i leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
i love him from the skin to my bones
but i don't wanna live in his home
there's nothing to say and he knows
i'll just runaway and be on my own
if we take this bird in, with its broken leg
we could nurse it, she said
come in side for a little lie down with me
and if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing
but when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
and tell me if i lie down, would you stay now?
let me hold ya, ohh
but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
and i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
my little bird
if we take a walk out, in the morning dew
we can lay down, so i'm next you
come inside for a little home made tea
and if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
and if i wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
i'm covered by nature and i'm safe now
underneath this oak tree, with you beside me
but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
and i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
my little bird
my little bird
my little bird
and of all this thing i'm sure of, i'm not quite certain of your love
you made scream but then i made you cry when i left that little bird with its broken leg to die
but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
but i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
my little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa
my little bird
my little bird
your my little bird
in shadow there lies hope
cut tension with a knife
i find it hard to cope
stop playing with my life
you analyse my fears
analyse my dreams
choke on burning tears
through my silent screams
things aren't what they seem
tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
tell this army of angels to make me breathe
open doors just to take away the key
i'll let you all see that i'm doing better
watch me fall
as i stumble at your feet
always losing in this game
your lies cut me deep
and you don't even know my name
with your consistency
to always make me crawl
and my durability
not affected at all
still things aren't what they seem
tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
tell this army of angels to make me breathe
open doors just to take away the key
i'll let you all see that i'm doing better
feel the pain
on my brain
feel the strain
as i start to decay
feel the strain
every passing day
feel the pain
as i start to decay
tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
tell this army of angels to make me breathe
open doors just to take away the key
i'll let you all see that i'm doing better
well, i've walked this street before
and everyone's locked up their door
cause they heard me coming
and i've been running
from what
i don't know if she's there
or if she's cares
it's taken you a long time to see
you've got a goldfish memory
this song's for you, not for me
in misery
it's taken you a long time to see
you've got a goldfish memory
this song's for you, not for me
in misery
you said we went too fast
and you said we wouldn't last
now i've put the past behind me
and i'm running
from what
i don't know if she's there
or if she cares
it's taken you a long time to see
you've got a goldfish memory
this song's for you, not for me
in misery
it's taken you a long time to see
you've got a goldfish memory
this song's for you, not for me
in misery
yeah, in misery
yeah, in misery
yeah, in misery
yeah, in misery
it's taken you a long time to see
it's taken you a long time to see
in misery
i found a love for me
oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, i found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was, i will not give you up this time
but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all i own
and in your eyes, you're holding mine
baby, i'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess, i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
sei la mia donna, la forza delle onde del mare
cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti e molto di pi
spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
e siamo sempre bambini ma nulla  impossibile
stavolta non ti lascer
mi baci piano ed io torno ad esistere
e nel tuo sguardo crescer
ballo con te, nell'oscurit, stretti forte poi
a piedi nudi noi, dentro la nostra musica
ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto
tu stasera, vedi, sei perfetta per me
ballo con te, nell'oscurit, stretti forte poi
a piedi nudi noi, dentro la nostra musica
ho creduto sempre in noi
perch sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
quanto ti ho aspettato
perch tu stasera sei perfetta per me
i paid all my dues
and she wanted to know
that i'd never leave her
now i'm ready to go
as strange as it seems
she's endless to me
she's just like paperwork but harder to read
patience's my enemy
loving's my friend
it's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend
oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
i made all my plans
and as she has made hers
she kept me in mind
but i wasn't sure
i searched every room
for a way to escape
but every time i try to leave she keeps holding on to me for dear life
and blocking my way
patience's my enemy
loving's my friend
it's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend
oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
and like the back of her hand she already understands everything
won't you stay she says
and she already knows how it goes
and where she stands i'll stay, anyway
cause she knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
i know myself
oh she, knows me like i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i can taste salt water
and if i blink again
you'll be sinking in
so we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
i hold you and you think of him
and pretty soon you'll be floating away
and i'll hold on to the words you spoke of
anchored down in my throat, love
and i'm captain of this sinking boat, now
with just one armband to carry me home
when salted tears won't dry
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
i still taste salt water
on my lips from your kiss bitterness
and i drown within the ocean you made
and i hate to love you, these cuffs covered in your make up
i'll never trust you again
you can just be a friend
and i'll hold on to the words you spoke of
anchored down in my throat, love
and i'm captain of this sinking boat, now
with just one armband to carry me home
when salted tears won't dry
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
your eyes, your lips, your mouth
your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
tonight, the fact design
i'm on my way home
on the way home
i lied, i tried to cry but i'm
i'm drowning in the ocean you made
when salted tears won't dry
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
i'll wipe my shirtsleeves
under your eyes
your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
no, no, no, no, no
i heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
goes to the gym at least six times a week
wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
and i hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats
he's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
owns every single ministry cd
tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
but i heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
but still, i'm just keepin' it real
still lookin' at your instagram and i'll be creepin' a lil'
i'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
cause i know that's where the trouble's at
let me remind you of the days when
you used to hold my hand
and when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
i guess if you were lois lane, i wasn't superman
just a young boy tryin' to be loved
so let me give it to ya
i don't wanna know about your new man
cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be calling me up trying to
cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missing all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
your new man rents a house in the 'burb
and wears a man bag on his shoulder, but i call it a purse
every year, he goes to mlaga with all the fellas
drinks beer, but has a six pack, i'm kinda jealous
he wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
and every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
says, cheya!, boy never light up the room
but enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
you were the type of girl who sat beside the water reading
eatin' a packet of the crisp, but you will never find you cheating
now you're eating kale, hitting the gym
keepin' up with kylie and kim
in the back of the club, kissing a boy that ain't him
okay, you need to be alone
and if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
i just thought i would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
you're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
so let me give it to ya
i don't wanna know about your new man
cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be calling me up trying to
cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missing all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
baby, i'm not trying to ruin your week
but you act so differently
when you're with him, i know you're lonely
please remember you're still free
to make the choice and leave
don't call me up, you need to show me
i don't wanna know about your new man
cause if it was meant to be
you wouldn't be calling me up trying to
cause i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
i don't wanna know about your new man
we'll get there eventually
i know you're missing all this kind of love
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
i don't wanna know about your new man
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
you so dope, don't overdose
i'm so stoked, i need a toast
we do the most, i'm in the ghost like i'm whippin' a boat
i got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
i'm a call away whenever you need me
i'm in a g5 , come to the aside
i got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
you love it, i love it, too, 'cause you my type
you hold me down and i protect you with my life
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you
like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say
but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
now well, when i was young, we connected
when we were little bit older, both sprung
i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
reputation precedes me and rumors are knee deep
the truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
and you understand the good and bad end up in a song
for all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
for all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july
i've passed days , this end game isn't won
with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say, yeah, but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
hey, big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
i hit you like bang
we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's a truth from my red lips
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
filled up with doubt
i have to move home
but i want to stay with you

if you want to see the world
then please ask your mother
i cannot hold your hand
to watch you go
i am a liar
as you might know
i need you now
i need your touch
and your lips

come on skinny love just last the year
pour a little salt we were never here
my my my  my my my
my my
staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
i tell my love to wreck it all
cut all of the ropes and let me fall
my my my  my my my
my my
right in the moment this order's tall
and i told you to be patient
and i told you to be fine
and i told you to be balanced
and i told you to be kind
and in the morning i'll be with you
but it will be a different kind
cause i'll be holding all the tickets
and you'll be owning all the fines
come on skinny love what happened here
suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
my my my  my my my
my my
sullen load is so slow on the spit
and i told you to be patient
and i told you to be fine
and i told you to be balanced
and i told you to be kind
and now all your love is wasted
well then who the hell was i?
cause now i'm breaking at the britches
and at the end of all your lines
who will love you? who will fight?
and who will fall, far behind?
who will love you? who will fight?
and who will fall, far behind?
they say boys don't cry
but your dad has shed a lot of tears
they say i should be a strong man
but baby, i'm still filled with fear
sometimes i don't know who i am
sometimes i question why i'm here
i just wanna be a good dad
will i be? i have no idea
they say girls shouldn't be tough
and moms should raise their kids at home
but baby, i know that that isn't true
cause your momma's the toughest person i know
i wanna raise you to be like her
and watch you show the world how to do it on your own
i'm still tryna figure out who i am
i don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
i'm gonna be there for your first breath
i don't know if i'll be there for your first step
i can promise you that i'll try to work less
but the tour's routed, and i got this album
put in so many hours, and i just want the outcome
to be something that i can look back and i can be proud of
don't wanna be a dad that's living in facetime
but i've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
i won't spoil you, you can trust that
for your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
had your heart broken? been there, done that
i love you and i can't give you enough of that
get back to community that raised you up
read langston hughes, i suggest a raisin in the sun
listen to sam cooke, a change gon' come
you put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
don't try to change the world, find something that you love
and do it every day
do that for the rest of your life
and eventually, the world will change
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up
i recommend that you read the alchemist
listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
and every day, give your momma a compliment
take your girl to the prom
but don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
slow dance with your woman in your arms
sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
don't wake your mom up
do yoga, learn 'bout karma
find god, but leave the dogma
the quickest way to happiness? learning to be selfless
ask more questions, talk about yourself less
study david bowie, james baldwin and 2pac
watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
wear a helmet, don't be stupid
jaywalk, but look before you do it
if it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
take risks, cause life moves so fast
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know, but who am i if
i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up, ooh
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up
i'm gonna pick up the pieces
and build a lego house
if things go wrong we can knock it down
my three words have two meanings
there's one thing on my mind
it's all for you
and it's dark in a cold december,
but i've got you to keep me warm
if you're broken i will mend you
and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now
i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now, now
i'm gonna paint you by numbers
and color you in
if things go right we can frame it
and put you on a wall
and it's so hard to say it
but i've been here before
now i'll surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours
i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now
i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now
don't hold me down
i think the braces are breaking,
and it's more than i can take
and it's dark in a cold december,
but i've got you to keep me warm
if you're broken i will mend you
and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now
i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now
i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i will love you better now
you're not her
though i try to see you differently
i towed the line, you see
i'm searching for what used to be mine, oh
and i saw your eyes
and i saw alice staring back at me
so i will try to find another one
who's suited to me as well as her
i've moved far away from you
and i want to see you here beside me, dear
but things aren't clear
when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you and i miss you
she was mine, i was hers
and all that's in between
when she would cry, i would shelter her
and keep her from the darkness that will be
if i moved far away from you
and i want to see you here beside me, dear
but things aren't clear, whoa
when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you and i'd miss you
don't drop me in, it's not my time
if you cut deep then i might burn at you
scar and left me like a sunburn
don't drop me in, it's not my time
if you cut deep then i might burn at you
scar and leave me like a sunburn
we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you and i miss you
the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast, and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me, i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop
put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance
and now i'm singing like
girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now, follow my lead
come, come on now, follow my lead
i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
oh, i'm in love with your body
ohiohiohiohi
oh, i'm in love with your body
ohiohiohiohi
oh, i'm in love with your body
ohiohiohiohi
oh, i'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
one week in we let the story begin
we're going out on our first date
but you and me are thrifty
so go allyoucaneat
fill up your bag, and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
and leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
tell the driver make the radio play
and now i'm singing like
girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead
i may be crazy, don't mind me
say boy, let's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me

well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
my knees feel weak and i fell too fast
the tide is high but we swam in too deep
to catch your breath
you tear me apart piece by piece
you can take away all this mess and
i could never think anything less of you
cos you break me
you numb me
you still seem to stun me
this pain has outrun me
you are all i have left
the tide flows out as i leave empty rooms
to spur this on
we left that room too long
you open wide and all the lies flow out
to eat you whole
but we both know that you're too cold
and she said 'i can put away
all those lies and
show you there's no surprise in me'
well still, you break me
you numb me
you still seem to stun me
this pain has outrun me
you are all that i have left
you break me
you numb me
you still seem to stun me
this pain has outrun me
you are all that i have left
exorcise these demons
but they keep talking to me
i am no believer
but i believe you will relieve me
i believe you will relieve me
and that's what's going on
cos you break me
you numb me
you still seem to stun me
this pain has outrun me
you are all that i have left
you break me
you numb me
you still seem to stun me
this pain has outrun me
you are all that i have left
you break me
you break me
you break me
you break me
i felt the fall on my breast
at the bottom of my stomach
she put my hand on her chest
while she looked into my eyes
you rescued me
and called up these words in threes
and you know i can't forget it
and 10 months on you liberate truth
see, i was wrong on how i hate you
and it's the worst thing that i did
when i read through you
you weren't translated
so i looked up love in the yellow pages
so i'd be free from it
see, all this truth sparks lies in me
just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
the key is just to ignore
even if this time has made me unsure
and 12 months on i'm back in my mood
see, i got drunk and said i loved you
and it's the worst thing that i did
when i read through you
you weren't translated
so i looked up love in the yellow pages
so i'd be free from it
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i'm saying hush little baby
don't you cry
daddy ain't sure he can raise you right
i ain't even good with saving my money
why should i think i could save your life
the whole family's gonna think i'm a devil
cah i don't want to see my angels eyes
i say this with one hand on my heart
guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
my thoughts were my worst thoughts
running through my head in circles
the world's gonna hate me for saying this
but patience is a virtue
so we don't have to rush
for our first yute
we could take time do rehearsals
and i ain't acting, this is personal
and i ain't doing this just to hurt you
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
when i'm telling her about raving
she's telling me about cravings
i just want her to get the message
i don't want to have to be so blatant
so i told her my life ain't balanced yeah
so the time ain't right
she said god's clocks the only one that matters
and it's about time i tried
and if i listen to my family
then i'll be a new addition to my family
i can't help feeling peer pressured
everyone's looking down but
they don't understand me
and everyone's so suggestive
i'm getting mixed messages
but nobody's rang me huh
i ain't saying this is a game
but when i say the wrong thing
everybody wants to hang me
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
no
i said hush little baby
don't you cry
i should say goodbye before i say hello
so darling hold me closely tonight
cos' if you open your eyes i'll never let you go
moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
and i'll be dreaming till you wake me up
well i once heard a story about a rundown home
where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
he tried to live, no effort was shown
he's slowly finding a way back home
he had a family with smiles and frowns
they never could solve his way to be down
cause he's one dog who don't want a bone
he's slowly finding a way back home
he had a nice house with windows and doors
he said to his wife what's mine is yours
but the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
he's slowly finding a way back home
his children have left but the rooms are still there
his misses the noise and the scents in their hair
but far from the nest the babies have flown
he's slowly finding a way back home
his wife was an angel sent from above
he never returned her kisses or love
but soon he'd found that she'd overgrown
this man who's finding a way back home
so the leaves are all dead in this broken man's june
the rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
he stares at the floor, no more to roam
he's slowly finding a way back home
well i once heard a story about a rundown home
where a man with regrets lived all alone
he tried to live, no effort was shown
he'll never find a way back home
waking up
midnight november
and you're still in my bed
it's kinda rough
cause since i met ya
there's things we've never said
so if i go
for a little while longer
when i'm home
we can talk about the big falls of the road
if you say go
i would stop everything, oh
my heart would play the role now
and act like its never been broke
though, my soul
lately i really need to know
how long, how long can we be touch and go
oh my soul
how long, how long can we be touch and go
it's not enough
to say i want you
cause i'll say anything
i'm holding out
to feel without a doubt
i have just been questioning it
but if i go
for a little while longer
when i'm home
we can talk about the big falls of the road
and if you say go
i would stop everything, oh
my heart would play the role
and act like its never been broke
though, my soul
lately i really need to know
how long, how long can we be touch and go
oh, my soul
how long, how long can we be
all of my bones, they scream i'm right
if you're taking me home to stay the night
darling, my soul would heal
if you say go
i would stop everything, oh
my heart would play the role
and act like it's never been broke
oh, my soul
lately i really need to know
how long, how long can we be touch and go
oh, my soul
how long, how long can we be touch and go
how long, how long can we be touch and go
how long, how long can we be touch and go
made of clay
shoot me down
i'll ricochet to the ground
words of paint
draw me out
and fill me in with your mouth
and hold your tongue
and i know it's over before it's begun
i lost my way
so help me out
and lend your hand 'til i am found
my voice is mute
not to be heard
so it's up to you
for you to bring those words
i
and i
have come undone
for the last time
this grief you give
it takes it's toll
it dries my heart and drowns my soul
i am a tree
whose branch you broke
the brittle wood has turned stones, oh
i
and i
have come undone
for the last time
for the last time
for the last time
i
and i
have come undone
for the last time
for the last time
for the last time
everybody gets high sometimes, you know
what else can we do when we're feeling low?
so take a deep breath and let it go
you shouldn't be drowning on your own
and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
it's how we learn and how we grow
and i wanna lay with you 'til i'm old
you shouldn't be fighting on your own
and if you feel you're sinking, i will jump right over
into cold, cold water for you
and although time may take us into different places
i will still be patient with you
and i hope you know
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
come on, come on
save me from my rocking boat
i just wanna stay afloat
i'm all alone
and i hope, i hope someone come and take me home
somewhere i can rest my soul
i need to know you won't let go
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i'll be your lifeline tonight
i won't let go
i won't let go
you look so wonderful in your dress
i love your hair like that
the way it falls on the side of your neck
down your shoulders and back
we are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much
you got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
you look so beautiful in this light
you silhouette over me
the way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the tenerife sea
and all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath
just say the word and i will disappear into the wilderness
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
lumire, darling
lumire over me
lumire, darling
lumire over me
lumire, darling
lumire over me
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need
so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
you looked so wonderful in your dress
i loved your hair like that
and in the moment i knew you beth
i found your hair band on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that you've been here before
and i don't get waves of missing you anymore
they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
never getting dry, so i get high
smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye
and i'm still drunk at the end of the night
i don't drink like everybody else
i do it to forget things about myself
stumble and fall with the head spin i got
my mind's with you but my heart's just not
so am i close to you anymore, if it's over?
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
that's why you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
everybody said we'd be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down,
come around, break up the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you
sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
everything's great, not everything's sure
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now i'm in position to be another stalker
like everything i say seems to always sound awkward
like our last kiss, it was perfect
but we were nervous, on the surface
and i'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
pain is only relevent if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss
so am i close to you anymore, if it's over?
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
oh you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
because, if i was gonna go somewhere
i'd be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down
and i'm thinking i'm unaware
i keep my feet on the ground
and keep looking around,
to make sure i'm not
the only one to feel low
because if you want
i'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
from all that i've done wrong
and i know you'll say
that i'm the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will
cause you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one who knows that i lied
you and i ended over uni
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one who knows that i lied
leaves have fallen to the ground
and now there's no one else around
to hear the cry
i saw your body
i saw your face
loss of presence
loss of grace
behind those eyes
and we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
i miss your laughter
i miss your tears
i miss your rambling
about your fears
your smile
the crowed has gathered
all around
no ones speaking
no one makes a sound
and i
and we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
alone
alone now
they're never gonna change you
they're never gonna change me
they're never gonna change us
we'll always stay the same
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
so, so you think you can tell
heaven from hell, blue skies from pain
can you tell a greenfield
from a cold steel rail?
a smile from a veil?
do you think you can tell?
and did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
hot as he's for trees? hot air fora cool breeze?
cold comfort for change?
and did you exchange
a walk on part in the war
for a lead role in a cage?
how i wish, how i wish you were here
we're just two lost souls swimming ina fishbowl
year after year
running over the same old ground
what have we found? the same old fears
wish you were here
wish you were here
when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
and, darling, i will be loving you 'til we're 70
and, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
and i'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well, mei fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am
so honey now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
i'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe it's all part of a plan
well, i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand
but, baby, now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
so, baby, now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
oh, baby, we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are
ed sheeran
there must be some kind of way out of here
said the joker to the thief, yeah
there's too much confusion
mmm i can't get no relief
yeah
i see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
you'd find me in the middle if i picked a different life
before my name started tripling in size
but i'm still showing signs
in the pitch black, it's too cold
i'm all alone take me back to the roads
i had to rode to get here and i'll hitch back
get a cab to my mother's house
see my old man and grab a six pack
tell my brother i love him
and give him something that will see him through the hard times
what's a brother for?
when i'm sick of this life i see
it has to be my family who lift me off the floor
make sense of all the madness in a world full of money and
i was a failed man and worse i couldn't give a fuck
save your wine for the entrepreneurs
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
cause your world is the same as mine
pour more blood in your cup
take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
the flavour of an illmannered nature
that lingers on as animals in all of us
trying to fight for the right to live a life
but some will never win though
that's why they live a lie
i don't think i'll ever win
all of this is anything
when i die i hope a brother's at my side
there's no trap door, or get out clause
the world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
you've seen mine, i think it's time i see yours
i bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
some are lost some are
apart from the fact i live my life in the light and now i'm trapped in it
the way i feel within a few years time
i might have a couple kids and just forget i ever wrote this
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl
take away the treasure of a man
convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
even though i ain't religious i'm a little superstitious
maybe there is a promised land
but will i make it or not is a different matter
i've been a joker, i've been a thief, i've been a rapper
i've been the only enemy that i can never beat
give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
ed sheeran
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, yeah
outside in the cold distance

pass me a drink
you say it's gonna take a while
your consciousness sinks
tears from a crocodile
you're wasting your time
giving me the speech
you try to, don't reach
your smile
you're holding your tears
your inside is dead
you're eating your fears
in a cigarette
you've waited too long
to finally see
the sunshine in the rain
is as deep as the sea
i've taken the blow
it's all down on paper
had fun in the snow
but no 'see you later'
you're wasting your time
giving me the speech
you try to, don't reach
your smile
you're holding your tears

you're eating your fears
in a cigarette
you've waited too long
to finally see
the sunshine in the rain

well i walked from my house to yours
in a warm cold april rain
we barely went outdoors
and your family took the blame
take time to be with you
she can only glare
i'm a bad influence, that'll do
cause i need to cut my hair
wash my mouth, change my clothes
just don't talk to those friends of yours
tell them not to come here anymore
time to go, don't be slow
this'll only take a mo'
take yourself right out of my door
it's just that they don't care
dad said beware, watch your back
just don't reply to that woman there
and even if she makes a fuss
just ignore that trust
and don't give in to lust
and leave that one alone
the girl's trouble
time spent in burntdown shed
add up near two days
fall down and cut my head
take time to misbehave
spend time and be with you
she can only glare
cause you're a bad influence, that'll do
boy you need to cut your hair
wash your mouth, change your clothes
just don't talk to those friends of yours
tell them not to come here anymore
time to go, don't be slow
this'll only take a mo'
take yourself right out of my door

dad said beware, watch your back
just don't reply to that woman there
and even if she makes a fuss
just ignore that trust
and don't give in to lust
and leave that one alone
this is the dancing song
close your eyes
hypnotise to the beat
and the movement of the week
do that shuffle of your feet
and pound out the fever, either
dance as you're a true believer
cleaner lives are what you don't see
fell the weight, gravitate
feel the pace of me
this world is 2d
the only thing that's free in life is love
and that don't come cheap
it's just that they don't care
dad said beware, watch your back
just don't reply to that woman there
and even if she makes a fuss
just ignore that trust
and don't give in to lust
and leave that one alone
the girl's trouble

i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care
hi suzanne, but i shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first night, but tonight i am
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
a onenight stand turned a twonight stand
it was come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and
he found out, now she feels deserted and used
cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like holeinthewall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
my name's , my name's
river , river run
call me , call me
river , we'll let the river run
always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey!
fuck can i say? if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one
i don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when it's late
sirens bleed through my windowsill
i can't close my eyes
don't control what i'm into
this tower is alive
the lights that blind, keep me awake
hood up and lace untied
sleep fills my mind
can't control what i'm into
london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home, my home
i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in the backseat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps then that makes two
the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what i'm used to
and the shop across the road
fulfils my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices speak through my walls
i don't think i'm gonna make it
past tomorrow
london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home, my home
i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in the backseat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps then that makes two
and my lungs hurt and my ears bled
with the sound of the city life echoed in my head
do i need this to keep me alive?
the traffic stops and starts but i need to move along
london calls me a stranger
this is not my home, home
i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in the backseat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps then that makes two
i should ink my skin
with your name
and take my passport out again
and just replace it
see i could do without a tan on my left hand
where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
and i should run you a hot bath
and fill it up with bubbles
cause maybe you're loveable
maybe you're my snowflake
and your eyes turn from green to gray
in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place
and you should never cut your hair
cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder
and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe i'm just in love
when you wake me up
and would you ever feel guilty
if you did the same to me?
could you make me a cup of tea
to open my eyes in the right way?
and i know you love shrek
because we've watched it 12 times
but maybe you're hoping
for a fairytale too
and if your dvd breaks today
you should've got a vcr
because i've never owned a blueray,
true say
and now i've always been shit at computer games
because your brother always beats me
and if i lost, i'd go across
and chuck all the controllers at the tv
and then you'd laugh at me
and be asking me
if i'm gonna be home next week
and then you lie with me
till i fall asleep
and flutter eyelash on my cheek
between the sheets
and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe i'm just in love
when you wake me up
and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try and get me to stop
you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and i'll make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and i'll carve it like a necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
and now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now
cause maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
ain't got a soapbox i can stand upon
but god gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
my daddy told me son, don't you get involved in
politics, religions or other people's quarrels
i'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
i know when i have children, they will know what it means
and i'll pass on these things my family's given to me
just love and understanding, positivity
we could change this whole world with a piano
add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
i'm just a boy with a oneman show
no university, no degree, but lord knows
everybody's talking about exponential growth
and the stock market crashing in their portfolios
while i'll be sitting here with a song that i wrote
saying love could change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment
the revolution's coming, it's a minute away
i saw people marching in the streets today
you know we are made up of love and hate
but both of them are balanced on a razor blade
i'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
i know, i'm all for people following their dreams
just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
it's love and understanding, positivity
we could change this whole world with a piano
add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
i'm just a boy with a oneman show
no university, no degree, but lord knows
everybody's talking about exponential growth
and the stock market crashing in their portfolios
while i'll be sitting here with a song that i wrote
saying love could change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment
i'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
you know the future's in the hands of you and me
so let's all get together, we can all be free
spread love and understanding, positivity
we could change this whole world with a piano
add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
i'm just a boy with a oneman show
no university, no degree, but lord knows
everybody's talking about exponential growth
and the stock market crashing in their portfolios
while i'll be sitting here with a song that i wrote
saying love could change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment, but what do i know?
now i'm in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
that's you now
ciao seems like life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you now
and i can't, no i won't hush
i say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now
see i'm true
my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue i stick to other artists
i'm not you now that would be disastrous
let me sing then do my thing i'll move to greener pastures
see i'm real i do it all it's all me
i'm not fake don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

i sing and write my own tune and i write my own verse, hell
don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
call yourself a single writer, your just bluffing
names on the credits and you didn't write nothing
i sing fast, i know that all my shit is cool
i will blast and i didn't go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i can't last if i'm smoking on a crack pipe
and i won't be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger
than my songs are
never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically i'm demonstrating
when i perform live it feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young single writer like a gabriella cilmi
cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all you need me
and all i want in this cold world is to make music
and use it not to abuse it
and get infected then facted with the who's who of music
who did it, who is it, who's in it who's what the hell does it matter chitter chatter don't matter
with the yidi, yidi, yada
don't matter to me all i want is a bit of dignity
hear me to battle this industry
freely to be me in this cd needy world can you hear me?
hey
so i keep singing that
when i first started this rapping shit
i felt pressure from haters
became invaded with sadists
and just developed a hater radar i'm aimed for the stars
kept my grind in the dark
then they came with the remedy kicking rhymes with the melody
hennessey shots and all these fools on the block
who said you've got to be a gangster now to raise the top
i'm just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy with my head in the sky
ed sheeran urban angel
coming ready to die
so see the signs
stand at the side
open your eyes and take a look and realise
the resurrection's arrived
and as the mist clears
i arise from my tomb in the skies
all alone alonestar
urban angel rising from the ashes surprising
no haters, guiding no moving
i'm steady you can find me in the club bottle full of bub
mummy
i've got the x if you're into taking drugs
into having sex, i ain't into making love
come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
you can find me in the club, club bottle full of bubbly mummy

into having sex, i ain't into making love
come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
you so dope, don't overdose
i'm so stoked, i need a toast
we do the most, i'm in the ghost like i'm whippin' a boat
i got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
i'm a call away whenever you need me
i'm in a g5 , come to the aside
i got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
you love it, i love it, too, 'cause you my type
you hold me down and i protect you with my life
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you
like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say
but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
now well, when i was young, we connected
when we were little bit older, both sprung
i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
reputation precedes me and rumors are knee deep
the truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
and you understand the good and bad end up in a song
for all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
for all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july
i've passed days , this end game isn't won
with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex love you don't wanna see
i don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you, i just wanna be
drinking on a beach with you all over me
i know what they all say, yeah, but i ain't tryna play
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
ah, and you heard about me
oh, i got some big enemies
hey, big reputation, big reputation
ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
ah, and i heard about you
ooh, you like the bad ones, too
i hit you like bang
we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's a truth from my red lips
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your ateam
i wanna be your end game, end game
strings on my guitar are rusty
even my best friends don't trust me
everybody thinks i must be crazy
cause, i'm your typical average teen
if you know what i mean
cause, i'm your typical average teen
if you know what i mean
everything's in a haze
yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
everything's blurry
oh, what's happened to me?
say, i'm your typical average teen
if you know what i mean
now, i'm your typical average teen
if you know what i mean
typical average teen
if you know what i mean
now, i'm your typical average teen
if you know what i mean
typical average teen
typical average teen
typical average teen
typical average teen
typical average teen
if you know what i mean
yes, i'm your typical average teen
now i'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
that's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
see me lose focus, as i sing to you loud
and i can't, no, i won't hush

you need me
cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop till my name's in lights
at stadium heights with damien rice
on red carpets, now i'm on arabian nights
because i'm young i know my brother's gonna give me advice
long nighter, short height and i going hyper
never be anything but a singersongwriter, yeah
the game's over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal
people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows
but i haven't got a house plus i live on a couch
so you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out
from day one, i've been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now i'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
cause it's another day
plus i'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rapper's shoes using new laces
i'm selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows, if i'm not, i'm in the studio
truly broke, never growing up, call me rufio
melody music maker
reading all the papers
they say i'm upandcoming like i'm fucking in an elevator
cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all

i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through, this world alone
there's no sickness, toil or danger
and that bright land to which i go
and i'm going there to see my mother
and i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over home now
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
hey ey ey yeah
mmmm
ooohhh
i know dark clouds will gather me
i know my way's rough and steep
and the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
and i know my way's rough and steep
i'm going there to see my mother
i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over home now
cause' i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through, this world alone
there's no sickness, toil or danger
and that bright light to which i go
i'm going there to see my mother
i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going home now
when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
and, darling, i will be loving you till we're 70
and, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
and i'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well, me, i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am
so, honey, now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
maybe we found love right where we are
when my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
i'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
well, i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand
that, baby, now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are
la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud
so, baby, now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
i'm thinking out loud
then maybe we found love right where we are
oh, baby, we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are
now i don't wanna hate you
just wish you'd never gone for the man
and waited two weeks at least
before you let him take you
i stayed true
i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
he's waiting for the time to move
i knew he had his eyes on you
he's not the right guy for you
don't hate me cause i write the truth
no, i would never lie to you
but it was never fine to lose you
and what a way to find out!
it never came from my mouth
you never changed your mind
but you were just afraid to find out
but fuck it
i won't be changing the subject, i love it
i'll make your little secret public, it's nothing
i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet
to get back at me
trapped and i'm lacking sleep
fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually
you're practically my family
if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be
but tragically our love just lost the will to live
but would i kill to give it one more shot?
i think not
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
recently i tend to zone out
up in my headphones to holocene
you promised your body but i'm away so much
i stay more celibate than in a monastery
i'm not cut out for life on the road
cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much
and at the time we'd just go
so sue me
i guess i'm not the man that you need
ever since you went to uni
i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
full of less cash and i guess that could get bad
but when i broke the industry
that's when i broke your heart
i was supposed to chart and celebrate
but good things are over fast
i know it's hard to deal with and see this
i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
then i turn the music off
and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, jesus
i never really want to believe this
got advice from my dad
and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need
i guess i'm unaware of it
success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
and since you left
i've given up my days off
it's what i need to stay strong
i know you have a day job
but mine is 247
i fell like writing a book
i guess i lied in the hook cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could
the irony is if my career and music didn't exist
in 6 years yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink
and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's
just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill
and i'd be writing my will before i'm 27
i'll die from a thrill
go down in history as just a wasted talent
can i face the challenge
or did i make a mistake erasing?
it's only therapy
my thoughts just get ahead of me
eventually i'll be fine, i know that it was never meant to be
either way i guess i'm not prepared
but i'll say this
these things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
take my apology
i'm sorry for the honesty
but i had to get this off my chest
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
this is the start of something beautiful
this is the start of something new
you are the one that will make me lose it all
you are the start of something new
and i'll throw it all away
and watch you fall into my arms again
and i'll throw it all away
and watch you fall, now
you are the earth i will stand upon
you are the words i will sing
and i've thrown it all away
and watched you fall into his arms again
and i've thrown it all away
and watched you fall, now
and take me back
take me home
watch me fall, down to earth
take me back
for this is the start of something beautiful
you are the start of something new

that boy spit venom, make a nun turn tricks
no teeth, just tongue and some lips wit' the shit
mustard on the beat, but it's some ritz in this bitch
well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
she's got that street flow, i still wanna hit it slow
she's got that heat on hold, bend the weed i smoke
know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
she's got that street flow, i still wanna hit it slow
she's got that heat on hold, bend the weed i smoke
know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
they say boys don't cry
but your dad has shed a lot of tears
they say i should be a strong man
but baby, i'm still filled with fear
sometimes i don't know who i am
sometimes i question why i'm here
i just wanna be a good dad
will i be? i have no idea
they say girls shouldn't be tough
and moms should raise their kids at home
but baby, i know that that isn't true
cause your momma's the toughest person i know
i wanna raise you to be like her
and watch you show the world how to do it on your own
i'm still tryna figure out who i am
i don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
i'm gonna be there for your first breath
i don't know if i'll be there for your first step
i can promise you that i'll try to work less
but the tour's routed, and i got this album
put in so many hours, and i just want the outcome
to be something that i can look back and i can be proud of
don't wanna be a dad that's living in facetime
but i've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
i won't spoil you, you can trust that
for your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
had your heart broken? been there, done that
i love you and i can't give you enough of that
get back to community that raised you up
read langston hughes, i suggest a raisin in the sun
listen to sam cooke, a change gon' come
you put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
don't try to change the world, find something that you love
and do it every day
do that for the rest of your life
and eventually, the world will change
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up
i recommend that you read the alchemist
listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
and every day, give your momma a compliment
take your girl to the prom
but don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
slow dance with your woman in your arms
sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
don't wake your mom up
do yoga, learn 'bout karma
find god, but leave the dogma
the quickest way to happiness? learning to be selfless
ask more questions, talk about yourself less
study david bowie, james baldwin and 2pac
watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
wear a helmet, don't be stupid
jaywalk, but look before you do it
if it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
take risks, cause life moves so fast
you're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know, but who am i if
i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'm still growing up, up, up, up
i'll be patient, one more month
you'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
times are changing, i know
but who am i if i'm the person you become
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
if i'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up, ooh
i'm still growing up
i'm still growing up
i stare at my reflection in the mirror
why am i doing this to myself?
losing my mind on a tiny error
i nearly left the real me on the shelf no
don t lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing, it s okay not to be okay
sometimes it s hard to follow your heart
tears don t mean you re losing, everybody s bruising
just be true to who you are
who you are
brushing my hair, do i look perfect?
i forgot what to do to fit the mold
then more i try the less it s working, yeah
cause everything inside me screams
no, no, no, no, no yeah
don t lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
it s okay not to be okay
sometime it s hard to follow your heart
but tears don t mean you re losing, everybody s bruising
just be true to who you are
fake shows, egos, fake shows like wow
and leave me alone
real talk, real life, good love, goodnightwith a smile
that s my home
don t lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
it s okay not to be okay
sometime it s hard to follow your heart
tears don t mean you re losing, everybody s bruising
just be true to who you are

and after all
you're my wonderwall

about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn't notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure
if he was from the house of lords
i saw a film today oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up i noticed i was late
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke
and somebody spoke and i went into a dream
i read the news today oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall
i'd love to turn you on
picture yourself in a boat on a river
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes
cellophane flowers of yellow and green
towering over your head
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
and she's gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high
newspaper taxis appear on the shore
waiting to take you away
climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and you're gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
picture yourself on a train in a station
with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
the girl with kaleidoscope eyes
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
lucy in the sky with diamonds

your voice is soothing
but the words aren't clear
you don't sound different
i've learned the game
i'm looking through you
you're not the same
why, tell me why
did you not treat me right?
love has a nasty habit
of disappearing overnight
you're thinking of me

is you're down there

and you're nowhere
why, tell me why

there are places i remember
all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life i've loved them all
but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new
though i know i'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i'll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
though i know i'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i'll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
in my life i love you more
if you've got trouble
then you got less trouble than me
you say you're worried
you can't be as worried as me
you're quite content to be bad
with all the advantage you had over me
just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me
i don't think it's funny
when you ask for money and things
especially when you're standing there
wearing diamonds and rings
you think i'm soft in the head
well try someone softer instead anything
it's not so funny
when you know what money can bring
you better leave me alone
i don't need a thing from you
you better take yourself home
go and count a ring or two
if you've got trouble
then you got less trouble than me
you say you're worried
you can't be as worried as me
you're quite content to be bad
with all the advantage you had over me
just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me
ah rock on, anybody
you better leave me alone
i don't need a thing from you
you better take yourself home
go and count a ring or two
if you've got trouble
then you got less trouble than me
you say you're worried
you can't be as worried as me
you're quite content to be bad
with all the advantage you had over me
just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me
just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me

well you call me your baby
when you hold in my hand
but the way that you hurt me
i just don't understand
well you say that you need me
like an ocean needs sand
but the way you deceive me
i just don't understand
well you know that i love you
more than anyone can
but a onesided love
i just don't understand
well you know that i love you
more than anyone can
but a onesided love
i just don't understand
well you call me your baby
when you hold in my hand
oh how you can hurt me
i just don't understand
i'm a loser
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be
of all the love i have won, and have lost
there is one love i should never have crossed
she was a girl in a million my friend
i should have known she would win in the end
i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be
although i laugh and i act like a clown
beneath this mask i am wearing a frown
my tears are falling like rain from the sky
is it for her or myself that i cry?
i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be
what have i done to deserve such a fate?
i realize i have left it too late
and so it's true pride comes before a fall
i'm telling you so that you won't lose all
i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be

john he was a fool unto himself
rocky raccoon
now rocky raccoon he was a fool unto himself,
and he would not swallow his foolish pride

a fellow went and stole his chick away from him
now rocky raccoon checked into his room
only to find gideon's bible
rocky had come equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival
his rival it seems had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy
her name was magill, and she called herself lil,
but ev'ryone knew her as nancy
now she and her man, who called himself dan,
were in the next room at the hoedown
and rocky burst in and grinning a grin,
said, danny boy, this is a showdown
but daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner  ah

he's really sminking of gin,
and it did him in the end, poor doc
meantime, back on the table, yeah,
the doctor said, rock, you've met your match, son
rocky said, it's only a scratch, so i'll be better soon
you better be better soon, said the doc
come on, son, gotta get hip, gotta get up, gotta get back
to your gun, gotta go and shoot that danny boy
however, rocky raccoon, he fell back in his room

when it gets dark i tow your heart away
standing by
a parking meter
when i caught
a glimpse of rita

they'll never believe it!
in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
here beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back in
penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine

and i'll be better, i'll be better doc as soon as i am able
and now rocky raccoon he fell back in his room
only to find gideon's bible

you'd better keep your head, little girl
or i won't know where i am
you'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
hide your head in the sand, little girl
catch you with another man
that's the end, little girl
well, you know that i'm a wicked guy
and i was born with a jealous mind
and i can't spend my whole life tryin'
just to make you toe the line
you'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
hide your head in the sand, little girl
catch you with another man
that's the end, little girl
let this be a sermon
i mean everything i've said
baby, i'm determined
and i'd rather see you dead
you'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
hide your head in the sand, little girl
i catch you with another man
that's the end, little girl
i'd rather see you dead, little girl
than to be with another man
you'd better keep your head, little girl
or you won't know where i am
you'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
hide your head in the sand, little girl
catch you with another man
that's the end, little girl

we were talking
about the space between us all
and people who hide themselves
behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth
then it's far too late
when they pass away
we were talking
about the love we all could share
when we find it
to try our best to hold it there
with our love, with our love
we could save the world
if they only knew
try to realize it's all within yourself
no one else can make you change
and to see you're really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you
we were talking
about the love that's gone so cold
and the people who gain the world
and lose their soul
they don't know, they can't see
are you one of them
when you've seen beyond yourself
then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
and the time will come
when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you

as someone with a name
did you mean to break my heart and watch me die

what goes on in your heart?
what goes on in your mind?
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind
in your mind
in your mind

would you lock the door?

doing the garden, digging the weeds
who could ask for more?

we shall scrimp and save
grandchildren on your knee

stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say

late night watching tv
wish that you were here beside me
wish that your arms were around me
your body on my body
i've been reading books of old
the legends, and the myths
achilles, and his gold
hercules, and his gifts
spiderman's control
and batman with his fists
and clearly i don't see myself upon that list
she said, where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts
some superhero
some fairytale bliss
just something i can turn to
somebody i can kiss
i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
oh, i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
oh, i want something just like this
i want something just like this
i've been reading books of old
the legends, and the myths
the testaments they told
the moon, and its eclipse
and superman unrolls
a suit before he lifts
but i'm not the kind of person that it fits
she said, where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts
some superhero
some fairytale bliss
just something i can turn to
somebody i can miss
i want something just like this
i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
oh, i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts
some superhero
some fairytale bliss
just something i can turn to
somebody i can kiss
i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
i turn the music up, i've got my records on
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
and all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
until monday morning feels another life
i turn the music up
i'm on a roll this time
and heaven is in sight
i turn the music up, i got my records on
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
don't want to see another generation drop
i'd rather be a comma than a full stop
maybe i'm in the black, maybe i'm on my knees
maybe i'm in the gap between the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart
and we saw oh this light
i swear you, emerge blinking into
to tell me it's alright
as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
and every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall
oh
is a waterfall
oh oh oh
is a is a waterfall
every tear
is a waterfall
oh oh oh
so you can hurt, hurt me bad
but still i'll raise the flag
oh
it was a wawawawawaaterfall
a wawawawawaaterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
one, two, three
fish fell out of water
bird stuck on the ground
chaos giving orders
everything is upside down
the whole world on a flight path
i wonder where they'll go, ah
trouble's on the outside, i know
but now, all i can think about is you
all i can think about is you
if all that i'm on earth to do
is solo, then what a lone poor shoe

he wrote it in a letter
he was a friend of mine
he heard you could see your future
inside a glass of water
with ripples and the rhymes
and he asked, will i see heaven in mine?
that is just the way it was
and nothing could be better
and nothing ever was
they say you can see your future
inside a glass of water
the riddles and the rhymes
will i see heaven in mine?
ohhhhhhhh
son
don't ask
neither how full nor empty
is your glass
cling
to the mast
spend your whole life
living in the past
going nowhere fast
so he wrote it on a wall
the hollowest of halos
is no halo at all
televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
saying nothing at all
and you chime
stars in heaven align
ohhhhhhhh
son
don't ask
neither how full nor empty
is your glass
cling
to the mast
spend your whole life
living in the past
going nowhere fast
what are we drinking when we're done?
glasses of water
oh, i think i've landed
in a world i hadn't seen
when i'm feeling ordinary
when i don't know what i mean
oh, i think i've landed
where there are miracles at work
for the thirst and for the hunger
come the conference of birds
and say it's true
it's not what it seems
leave your broken windows open
and in the light just streams
and you get a head
a head full of dreams
you can see the change you want to
be what you want to be
when you get a head
a head full of dreams
it's a love, i've just been spoken
with a head full, a head full of dreams
i sing, oh, i think i've landed
where there are miracles at work
now you've got me open handed
now you got me lost for words
i sing, oh
a head full of dreams
it's a love, i've just been spoken
with a head full, a head full of dreams
with a head, with a head
full of dreams
vim pra lhe encontrar,
dizer que sinto muito,
voc no sabe como voc  adorvel
eu tive que te encontar,
dizer que eu preciso de voc
dizer que eu te deixei distante
me conta seus segredos
e me pergunta suas duvidas
oh, vamos voltar para o comeo
correndo em crculos,
perseguindo caudas,
cabeas num silncio a parte
ningum disse que seria fcil,
uma pena mesmo nos separarmos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
nem disseram que seria to difcil assim
oh, leveme de volta ao comeo
eu s estava pensando,
em nmeros e figuras,
rejeitando os quebracabeas
perguntas de cincia,
cincia e progresso,
no fale to alto quanto meu corao
diga que me ama,
volte e assombreme,
oh, enquanto eu corro para o comeo
correndo em crculos, perseguindo caudas,
voltando ao que ns ramos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
oh,  uma pena mesmo nos separarmos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
nem disseram que seria to difcil assim
estou voltando ao comeo
ningum disse que era fcil
no oh, no oh, no oh
no oh, no oh, no oh
ningum disse que era fcil
no oh, no oh, no oh
ningum disse que era fcil
they're calling you
some kind of ghost
but i know that's not true
cause time and time again i spoke
and i have spoke with you
they're saying i
am some kind of ghost
but that's so hard to say
maybe i'll go
maybe you're safe
no there's no way to say
and i would love you
to come over
and i would love you
oh, they say people come
say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you, celestial
like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circle
in perfect purple
so how come things move on?
how come cars don't slow?
when it feels like the end of my world
when i should, but i can't, let you go?
but when i'm cold, cold
oh, when i'm cold, cold
there's a light that you give me
when i'm in shadow
there's a feeling you give me, an everglow
like brothers in blood
sisters who ride
and we swore on that night
we'd be friends 'til we die
but the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
life is short as the falling of snow
and now i'm gonna miss you, i know
but when i'm cold, cold
in water rolled, salt
i know that you're always with me
and the way you will show
and you're with me wherever i go
and you give me this feeling
this everglow
oh, what i would give for just a moment to hold
yeah, i live for this feeling, it's everglow
so if you love someone
you should let them know
oh, the light that you left me will everglow
well, they say people come
say people go
this particular diamond
is extra special
and you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you're celestial
when i should, but i can't, let you go
but when i'm cold
cold
when i'm cold
cold
there's a light that you give me
then i'm in shadows
it's a feeling within me, everglow
but my brothers in blood
sisters you write
and we swore on that night
we'd be friends 'til we die
with the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
life is short as the falling of snow
and oh, i'm gonna miss you, i know
but when i'm cold
cold
you were all
the sun
and i know that you're with me
in a way that you won't show
and you're with me wherever i go
but you give me this feeling, this everglow
oh, what i would give for just a moment to know
yeah, i live for this feeling, it's everglow
so if you love someone, you should let them know
oh, the light that you left me will everglow
come on, oh my star is fading
and i swerve out of control
and if i, oh if i'd only waited
i'd not be stuck here in this hole
come here, oh my star is fading
and i swerve out of control
and i swear i waited and waited
i've got to get out of this hole
but time is on your side
it's on your side, now
not pushing you down
and all around
it's no cause for concern
come on, oh my star is fading
and i see no chance of release
and i know i'm dead on the surface
but i am screaming underneath
and time is on your side
it's on your side, now
not pushing you down
and all around
oh, it's no cause for concern
stuck on the end of this ball and chain
and i'm on my way back down again
stood on the edge
tied to a noose
sick to the stomach
you can say what you mean
but it won't change a thing
i'm sick of the secrets
stood on the edge, tied to the noose
she came along and she cut me loose
you came along and you cut me loose
you came along and you cut me loose
we were just about to lose our home
diamonds ate the radio
moving in the dead of night
we took photographs
just some just so
history has some to know
we were moving at the speed of flight
kids
cry
if you
want to
that's alright
if you
want to
hold me
hold me tight
just an alien
we were hovering without a home
millions are ufo
hovering in hope some scope
tonight
sees the light and says
fly if you
want to
that's alright
but if you
want to
call me
call this line
just an alien
just an alien
oh we just want to get home again
tell your leader
sir or ma'am
we come in peace
we mean no harm
somewhere out there
in the unknown
all the et's are phoning home
watching my life
on the skyline
crossing your eyes
for a lifetime
just an alien
moving target
target movement
a patch a corner
of the spacetime
just an alien
turning toward it
turning pages
over asia
crossing ages
just an alien
oh we just want to get home again
at night they would go walking
til the breaking of the day
the morning is for sleeping
through the dark streets they go searching
to see god in their own way
save the night time for your weeping
your weeping
singing lalalalalalalalaiy
and the night over london lay
so we rode down to the river
where victorian ghosts pray
for their curses to be broken
we go wandering 'neath the arches
where the witches are and they say
there are ghost towns in the ocean
the ocean
singing lalalalalalalalaiy
and the night over london lay
god is in the houses
and god is in my head
and all the cemeteries of london
i see god come in my garden
but i don't know what he said
for my heart, it wasn't open
not open
singing lalalalalalalalaiy
and the night over london lay
singing lalalalalalalalaiy
there's no light over london today
a flock of birds
hovering above
just a flock of birds
that's how you think of love
and i always look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly away
sometimes they arrive
sometimes they're gone
fly on
a flock of birds
hovering above
into smoke i'm turned and rise, following them up
still i always look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly away
one minute they arrive
next you know they're gone
fly on
fly on
so fly on, ride through
maybe one day i'll fly next to you
fly on, ride through
maybe one day i can fly with you
fly on
fly on
fly on

me between the eyes
and cry

when she was just a girl,
she expected the world,
but it flew away from her reach,
so she ran away in her sleep
dreamed of paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
every time she closed her eyes
ohoh ohoooh ohohoh
when she was just a girl,
she expected the world,
but it flew away from her reach,
and bullets catch in her teeth
life goes on,
it gets so heavy,
the wheel breaks the butterfly
every tear, a waterfall
in the night, the stormy night,
she closed her eyes
in the night,
the stormy night,
away she flied
i dream of paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
whoaohoh ohoooh ohohoh
she dreamed of paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
paraparaparadise,
whoaohoh ohoooh ohohoh

still lying underneath the stormy skies
she said ohohohohohoh

carved in your name with my pocket knife
and you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright
oh oh oh oh
feels like there's something broken inside
all i know
all i know
is that i'm lost whenever you go
all i know is that i love you so
so much that it hurts
got a tattoo and the pain's alright
just wanted a way of keeping you inside
oh oh oh oh oh oh
all i know
all i know
is that i'm lost in your fire below
all i know is that i love you so
so much that it hurts

i see your  and i'm dying of thirst
all i know is that i love you so
so much that it hurts
oh yeah yeah yeah
so much that it hurts
lovers, keep on the road you're on
runners, until the race is run
soldiers, you've got to soldier on
sometimes even right is wrong
they are turning my head out
to see what i'm all about
keeping my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day, we're gonna get out
tonight maybe we're gonna run
dreaming of the osaka sun
oh, oh
dreaming of when the morning comes
they are turning my head out
to see what i'm all about
keeping my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day the sun will come out
reign of love
i can't let go
to the sea i offer
this heavy load
locusts will
lift me up
i'm just a prisoner
in a reign of love
locusts will
let us stop
i wish i'd spoken
to the reign of love
reign of love
by the church, we're waiting
reign of love
my knees go praying
how i wish
i'd spoken up
or we'd be carried
in the reign of love
somewhere up above the stars
the wreckage of a universe floats past
somewhere up above my heart
a tiny little seed is sown,
a government is overthrown,
who knows when we'll be coming home at last
and i heard it on the radio
that one day we'll be living in the stars
and i heard it on a tv show
that somewhere up above
and in my heart
they'll be tearing us apart,
maybe moving us to mars
past the satellites and stars
maybe moving us to mars
we won't see the earth again
in these seconds just remain
unchanged
8 to 9, 9 to 10
we are meeting for the first time
we might never meet again you and me
we are meeting for the first time
can't you see
76543
we are meeting for the first time
singing this space symphony
they'll be tearing us apart
maybe moving us to mars,
past the satellites and stars
they're moving us to mars
a flock of birds
hovering above
just a flock of birds
that's how you think of love
and i always
look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly always
sometimes they arrive
sometimes they are gone
they fly on
a flock of birds
hovering above
into smoke i'm turned and rise
following them up
still i always
look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly always
one minute they arrive
next you know they're gone
they fly on
fly on
so fly on, ride through,
maybe one day i'll fly next to you
fly on, ride through,
maybe one day i can fly with you
fly on
and the hardest part
was letting go, not taking part
was the hardest part
and the strangest thing
was waiting for that bell to ring
it was the strangest start
i could feel it go down
bittersweet, i could taste in my mouth
silver lining the cloud
oh and i
i wish that i could work it out
and the hardest part
was letting go, not taking part
you really broke my heart, oh
and i tried to sing
but i couldn't think of anything
and that was the hardest part, oh, oh
i could feel it go down
you left the sweetest taste in my mouth
the silver lining the clouds
oh and i
oh and i
i wonder what it's all about
i wonder what it's all about
everything i know is wrong
everything i do, it just comes undone
and everything is torn apart
oh and it's the hardest part
that's the hardest part
yeah that's the hardest part
that's the hardest part
smoke is rising from the houses
people burying their dead
i ask somebody what the time is
but time doesn't matter to them yet
people talking without speaking
trying to take what they can get
i ask you if you remember
prospekt, how could i forget?
drums, here it comes
don't you wish that life can be as simple
as fish swimming round in a barrel?
when you've got the gun
oh when i run, here it comes
we're just two little figures in a soup bowl
trying to get to any kind of control
but i wasn't one
now here i lie on my own in a separate sky
here i lie on my own in a separate sky
i don't wanna die on my own here tonight
but here i lie on my own in a separate sky

black market, contraband,
and it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it
in a long black trench coat,
two hands around the throat,
ooh you want to get it right sometimes
there's so much to be scared of,
and not much to make sense of,
how did the clowns ever get control?
if your hear can you let me know,
how can they invade it, when it's so complicated?
ooh you just want to get it right sometimes
you just want to get it right sometimes
that's how you see the world,
how many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn,
that's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself,
you're not gonna give up
and there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening,
if you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful?
we don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped
ooh, we just want to get it right sometimes,
just want to get it right sometimes,
that's how you see the world,
how many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word,
that's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself,
cause nobody can hurt you
that's how you see the world
that's how you see the world

the future's for discovering
the space in which we're traveling
from the top of the first page
to the end of the last day
from the start in your own way
you just want somebody listening to what you say
it doesn't matter who you are
under the surface trying to break through
deciphering the codes in you
i need a compass, draw me a map
i'm on the top, i can't get back
whooooaaa, whooooaaa
the first line on the first page

you just want somebody listening to what you say
you just want somebody listening to what you say
it doesn't matter who you are
it doesn't matter who you are
is there anybody out there who
is lost and hurt and lonely too?
are they bleeding all your colours into one?
and if you come undone
as if you've been run through
some catapult had fired you
you wonder if your chance will ever come
or if you're stuck in square one
what if there was no line
nothing wrong, nothing right
what if there was no time
and no reason, or rhyme
what if you should decide
that you don't want me there by your side
that you don't want me there in your life
what if i got it wrong
and no poem or song
could put right what i got wrong
or make you feel i belong
and what if you should decide
that you don't want me there by your side
that you don't want me there in your life
ooh oohooh, that's right
let's take a breath, jump over the side
ooh oohooh, that's right
how can you know it if you don't even try
ooh oohooh, that's right
every step that you take
could be your biggest mistake
it could bend or it could break
that's the risk that you take
what if you should decide
that you don't want me there in your life
that you don't want me there by your side
ooh oohooh, that's right
let's take a breath, jump over the side
ooh oohooh, that's right
how can you know it when you don't even try
ooh oohooh, that's right
ohhh  ooh oohooh, that's right
let's take a breath, jump over the side
ooh oohooh, that's right
you know that darkness always turns into light
oohoohooh, that's right
lovers, keep on the road you're on
runners, until the race is run
soldiers, you've got to soldier on
sometimes even right is wrong
they are turning my head out
to see what i'm all about
keeping my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day, we are gonna get out
tonight maybe we're gonna run
dreaming of the osaka sun
ohh ohh
dreaming of when the morning comes
they are turning my head out
to see what i'm all about
keeping my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day the sun will come out
ooh
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead! long live the king!
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king?
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
a warning sign
i missed the good part then i realized
i started looking and the bubble burst
i started looking for excuses
come on in, i've gotta tell you what a state i'm in
i've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started looking for a warning sign
when the truth is
i miss you
yeah the truth is
that i miss you so
a warning sign
you came back to haunt me and i realized
that you were an island and i passed you by
and you were an island to discover
come on in, i've gotta tell you what a state i'm in
i've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started looking for a warning sign
when the truth is
i miss you
yeah the truth is
that i miss you so
and i'm tired
i should not have let you go
so i crawl back into your open arms
yes i crawl back into your open arms
and i crawl back into your open arms
yes i crawl back into your open arms
when it started, we had high hopes
now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
when it started, we were alright
but night makes a fool of us in the daylight
there we were dying of frustration
singing, lord lead me not into temptation
but it's not easy when she turns you on
sin, stay gone
if you'd only, if you'd only say yes
whether you will's anybody's guess
god, only god knows i'm trying my best
but i'm just so tired of this loneliness
so, up they picked me by the big toe
i was held from the rooftop, then they let go
dizzily screaming, let the windows down
as i crawl to the ground
if you'd only, if you'd only say yes
whether you will's anybody's guess
god, only god knows she won't let me rest
but i'm just so tired of this loneliness
i've become so tired of this loneliness

if you ever feel like something's missing
things you'll never understand

all this space i'm taking up
all this sound is breaking up, oh
maybe you'll get what you wanted
maybe you'll stumble upon it
everything you ever wanted
in a permanent state
maybe you'll know when you see it
maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
and when you find it you'll keep it
in a permanent state, a permanent state
when i was a young boy, i tried to listen

tide of the human races

you'll go backwards, but then
you'll go forwards again
you'll go backwards, but then
you'll go
created, then drilled and invaded
if somebody made it
someone will mess it up
and you are not wrong to
ask who does this belong to
it belongs to all of us
trying hard to speak and
fighting with my weak hand
driven to distraction

and i could write a song
a hundred miles long

and you belong with me
and i could write it down
or spread it all around
get lost and then get found
or swallowed in the sea
you put me on the line
and hung me out to dry
and darling that's when i
decided to go to see
you cut me down to size
and opened up my eyes

yeah, you belong with me
not swallowed in the sea
then there was rain
the sky wore a veil of gold and gray
at night it was the bright of the moon with me
time just floating
then there was rain
the sound foundations are crumbling
to the ground comes a bit of atumbling
and time just floated away
we watch it and stay and we can listen
oh rainy day, come 'round
sometimes i just want it to slow down
and we're separated now, i'm down
but i love when you come over to the house
i love it when you come over to my house
then there was rain
and i spent the night with the queen of spain
my lonely little heart would've broke again
time's still vicious
so when the deeper that the knife goes in
the more you win
you win but with less than when you begin
the deeper that the knife goes in, ohh
oh rainy day, come 'round
sometimes i just want it to slow down
and we're separated now, i'm down
but i love when you come over to the house
i love it when you come over to my house, oh, oh, oh
but i love it when you come over to the house
i love it when you come over to my house
i love it when you come over to the house
i love it when you come over to my house
lord i don't know which way i am going
which way the river gonna flow
it's just seems that upstream, i keep rowing
still got such a long way to go
still got such a long way to go
then that light, it's your eye
i know, i swear,
we'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
bullets fly, split the sky
but that's all right, sometimes, sunlight comes streaming through the holes
oooohhh ooooohh
fixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water hoping for the rain
up and up, up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
up and up, up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it's in your blood, it's in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up, up and up it's saying
we're going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we're going to get it get it together i know
going to get it get it together and flow
going to get it get it together and go
up and up, up and up
lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
up and up, up and up
how come people suffer how come people part?
how come people struggle how come people break your heart?
break your heart
yes i want to grow yes i want to feel
yes i want to know show me how to heal it up
heal it up
see the forest there in every seed
angels in the marble waiting to be freed
just need love just need love
when the going is rough saying

going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh

up and up, up and up
and you can say what is, or fight for it
close your mind or take a risk
you can say it's mine and clench your fist
or see each sunrise as a gift
we're going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we're going to get it get it together i know

when you think you've had enough
don't ever give up

vim pra lhe encontrar,
dizer que sinto muito,
voc no sabe como voc  adorvel
eu tive que te encontar,
dizer que eu preciso de voc
dizer que eu te deixei distante
me conta seus segredos
e me pergunta suas duvidas
oh, vamos voltar para o comeo
correndo em crculos,
perseguindo caudas,
cabeas num silncio a parte
ningum disse que seria fcil,
uma pena mesmo nos separarmos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
nem disseram que seria to difcil assim
oh, leveme de volta ao comeo
eu s estava pensando,
em nmeros e figuras,
rejeitando os quebracabeas
perguntas de cincia,
cincia e progresso,
no fale to alto quanto meu corao
diga que me ama,
volte e assombreme,
oh, enquanto eu corro para o comeo
correndo em crculos, perseguindo caudas,
voltando ao que ns ramos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
oh,  uma pena mesmo nos separarmos
ningum disse que seria fcil,
nem disseram que seria to difcil assim
estou voltando ao comeo
ningum disse que era fcil
no oh, no oh, no oh

ningum disse que era fcil
no oh, no oh, no oh
ningum disse que era fcil
oooooh, eeh!
oooooh, eeh, oooh!
ooooh, eh!
so we left la mancha,
headed out for higher plains
me and sancho panza
looking for adventure,
rosinante at the reigns,
to the windmills answer,
you'll never be lonely
you'll never be loney ever again
you'll never be lonely
you'll never be lonely again
i heard you never get wet in spanish rain
so they sent the doctor
for examining my brain
said  he's not too clever
when the world, when the world just seems
a little bit too cruel
gonna leave it better
make one better  hey!
so tell that princess

tell that princess  she'll never be lonely again
i heard you never get wet in spanish rain
ooooh, eh!
oooooh, eh, oooh
oooooh eh
i heard you never get wet in spanish rain
the hardest part
was letting go not taking part
was the hardest part
and the strangest thing
was waiting for that bell to ring
it was the strangest start
i could feel it go down
bittersweet i could taste in my mouth
oh silver lining the clouds
oh but i
i wonder what it's all about
the hardest part
was letting go not taking part
you really broke my heart, oh
and i tried to sing
but i couldn't think of anything
that was the strangest start, oh, oh
i could feel it go down
you left the sweetest taste in my mouth
oh silver lining the cloud
oh but i
oh yes i
i wonder what it's all about
cause everything i know is wrong
and everything i do it just comes undone
and everything is torn apart
oh, and that's the hardest part
that's the hardest part
that's the hardest part
that's the hardest part
postcards from far away
instrumental
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead, long live the king!
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castle stands
upon pillars of salt, and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a'ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you'd gone it was never,
never an honest word
that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
ohwho would ever wanna be king
i hear jerusalem bells were ringing
roman cavalry choirs were singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know st peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
here jerusalem bells were ringing
roman cavalry choirs were singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know st peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
the birds they sang, at break of day
start again, i hear them say
it's so hard to just walk away
the birds they sang, all a choir
start again a little higher
it's a spark in a sea of grey
the sky is blue
dreamed out loud 'til it's true
then takin' back the punch i threw
my arms turn wings
oh, those clumsy things
send me up to that wonderful world
and then i'm up with the birds
might have to go
where they don't know my name
float all over the world
just to see her again
and i won't show or fear any pain
even though all my armour
might rust in the rain
a simple plot but i know one day
good things are coming our way
a simple plot but i know one day
good things are coming our way
oh, yeah!!!
x and y
the land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
that and this
we're part of a bigger plan
don't know what it is
don't know what it is
you and me
the land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
i am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
hang on a minute, just a minute, please
i'll come
and everything under the sun
and everything under the sun
what is this feeling that i can't explain?
and why am i never gonna sleep again?
what is this thing i've never seen before?
a little boy lost in a breaking storm
hide and sob, and away they fly
to write your name in the summer sky
life has really only just begun
life that comes
and everything under the sun
x is y
the land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
all of the surface and the underneath
searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
and everything under the sun
and everything under the sun
what is this feeling that i can't explain?
and why am i never gonna sleep again?
what is this thing i've never seen before?
a little boy lost in a breaking storm
hide and sob, and away they fly
to write your name in the summer sky
life has really only just begun
life that comes
and everything under the sun
and you don't know that you've been born
can't see the calm until the storm
can't tell your right side from your wrong
can't see the wave you're riding on
so i look in your direction
but you pay me no attention, do you?
i know you don't listen to me
cause you say you see straight through me
don't you?
but on and on
from the moment i wake
to the moment i sleep
i'll be there by your side
just you try and stop me
i'll be waiting in line
just to see if you care
oh, did you want me to change?
well i'd change for good
and i want you to know that you'll always get your way
and i wanted to say
don't you shiver
don't you shiver
i'll sing it loud and clear
and i'll always be waiting for you
so you know how much i need you
but you never even see me do you?
and is this my final chance of getting you?
but on and on
from the moment i wake
to the moment i sleep
i'll be there by your side
just you try and stop me
i'll be waiting in line
just to see if you care, if you care
did you want me to change?
well i'd change for good
and i want you to know that you'll always get your way
and i wanted to say
don't you shiver

so loud and so clear
i sing it loud and clear
and i'll always be waiting for you
so i look in your direction
but you pay me no attention
and you know how much i need you
but you never even see me
so it's over
this time i know it's gone
salt water
tasted it too long
i only know i'm wrong
now i know it's gone
up in flames
up in flames
up in flames
we have slowly gone
so it's over
this time you're flying on
this time i know no song
can stop its slowly burn
can stop its slowly gone
up in flames
up in flames
up in flames
we have slowly gone
up in flames
up in flames
up in flames
we have slowly gone
we have slowly gone
can we pour some water on?
for a second, i was in control
i had it once, i lost it though
and all along the fire below would rise
and i wish you could have let me know
what i really going on below
i've lost you now, you let me go
but one last time
tell me you love me
if you don't then lie
lie to me
remember once upon a time
when i was yours and you were blind
the fire would sparkle in your eyes
and mine
so tell me you love me
if you don't then lie
lie to me
just tell me you love me
if you don't then lie
lie to me
and call it true
call it true love
call it true
call it true love
you cut me down a tree
and brought it back to me
and that's what made me see
where i was going wrong
you put me on a shelf
and kept me for yourself
i can only blame myself
you can only blame me
and i could write a song
a hundred miles long
well, that's where i belong
and you belong with me
and i could write it down
or spread it all around
get lost and then get found
or swallowed in the sea
you put me on the line
and hung me out to dry
and darling that's when i
decided to go to see
you cut me down to size
and opened up my eyes
made me realize
what i could not see
and i could write a book
the one they'll say that sthe world, and then it took
it took it back from me
and i could write it down
or spread it all around
get lost and then get found
and you'll come back to me
not swallowed in the sea
and i could write a song
a hundred miles long

and you belong with me
the streets your walking on
a thousand houses long

they were sitting
they were sitting in the strawberry swing
every moment was so precious
they were sitting
they were talking in the strawberry swing
everybody was for fighting

cold cold water, bring me 'round
now my feet won't touch the ground
cold cold water, whatcha say?
it's such, it's such a perfect day

i don't mind
without you, it's a waste of time
now the sky could be blue
could be grey
without you, i'm just miles away
now the sky could be blue
i don't mind
without you, it's a waste of time
oh morning
come bursting
the clouds amen
lift off this blindfold, let me see again
bring back the water that your ships roll in
in my heart she left a hole
the tightrope that i'm walking just sways and ties
the devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
and i just want to be there when the lightning strikes
and the saints go marching in
and sing
slowowowowowowowowowowit down
through chaos as it swirls
it's us against the world
like a river to a raindrop
i lost a friend
my drunken hazard daniel in a lion's den
and tonight i know it all has to begin again
so whatever you do, don't let go
and if we could float away
fly up to the surface
and just start again
lift off before trouble
just erodes us in the rain
just erodes us in the rain
just erodes us, and see roses in the rain
sing
slowowowowowowowowowowit down
slowowowowowowowowowowit down
through chaos as it swirls
it's us against the world
through chaos as it swirls
it's us against the world

achilles, and his gold
hercules, and his gifts
spiderman's control

the moon, and its eclipse
and superman unrolls
a suit before he lifts
but i'm not the kind of person that it fits
she said, where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts
some superhero

somebody i can miss
i want something just like this
i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
oh, i want something just like this
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
doodoodoo, doodoo
doodoodoo, doodoodoo
where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts
some superhero
some fairytale bliss
just something i can turn to
somebody i can kiss
i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
oh, i want something just like this
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead! long live the king!
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king?
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
i know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
i went digging for gold
i went down to the valley
over by the mountain
where the prospektor had been told
i'm marching through the cold
i'm marching through the cold
i went digging for gold
i went down with my brother
a bucket and a shovel
and a book about the colour of coal
i'm marching through the cold
we're marching through the cold
there's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
saying ''what use the metal if the metal don't shine?''
she said ''bring me back a diamond 'cause i really want one''
now i been digging so long that i never see the sun
i went digging for gold
i went down to the valley
over by the mountain
where the prospektor had been told
i'm marching through the cold
we're marching through the cold
there's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
saying ''what use the metal if the metal don't shine?''
she said ''bring me back a diamond
cause i really want one''
now i been digging so long that i never see the sun
now i been digging so long that i never see the sun
now i been digging so long that i never see the sun
was a long and dark december
from the rooftops i remember
there was snow
white snow
clearly i remember
from the windows they were watching
while we froze down below
when the future's architectured
by a carnival of idiots on show
you'd better lie low
if you love me
won't you let me know?
was a long and dark december
when the banks became cathedrals
and a fox became god
priests clutched onto bibles
hollowed out to fit their rifles
and the cross was held aloft
bury me in armor
when i'm dead and hit the ground
my nerves are poles that unfroze
if you love me
won't you let me know?
i don't want to be a soldier
who the captain of some sinking ship
would stow, far below
so if you love me
why'd you let me go?
i took my love down to violet hill
then we sat in snow
all that time she was silent still
so if you love me
won't you let me know?
if you love me
won't you let me know?
one, two
steal my heart and hold my tongue
i feel my time, my time has come
let me in, unlock the door
i never felt this way before
and the wheels just keep on turning
the drummer begins to drum
i don't know which way i'm going
i don't know which way i've come
hold my head inside your hands
i need someone who understands
i need someone, someone who hears
for you i've waited all these years
for you, i'd wait till kingdom come
until my day, my day's done
and say, you'll come and set me free
just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
in your tears and in your blood
in your fire and in your flood
i hear you laugh, i heard you sing
i wouldn't change a single thing
and the wheels just keep on turning
the drummers begin to drum
i don't know which way i'm going
i don't know what i've become
for you i'd wait till kingdom come
until my day's, my day's done
say, you'll come and set me free
just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
when you try your best
but you don't succeed
when you get what you want
but not what you need
when you feel so tired
but you can't sleep
stuck in reverse
and the tears come streaming down your face
when you lose something you can't replace
when you love someone but it goes to waste
could it be worse?
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you
and high up above or down below
when you're too in love to let it go
but if you never try you'll never know
just what you're worth
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you
tears stream down your face
when you lose something you cannot replace
tears stream down your face
and i
tears stream down your face
i promise you i will learn from my mistakes
tears stream down your face
and i
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones and i will try to fix you
climb up your mountain
nineteen and countin'
you have got seven, i have got one
blinded and hurtin'
this i'm deserving
i've got my secrets
you've only got the sleeping sun
when you've got a secret
then you've got to keep it
when you've got a question
answers will come
running and hiding
take and dividing
you've got your secrets
i've only got a sleeping sun
sleeping sun
singing
oooh um
ohhhh oh
ahhh ahh
oh oh
oh oh
oh ohh
and you, as i, saw
a piece in a jigsaw
run up and around it and
jump up real tall
run round the houses
north and the souths'
you've got your answers we've
only got a sleeping sun
sleeping sun
singing
oooh um
ohhhh oh
ahhh ahh
oh oh
oh oh
oh ohh

a warning sign
i missed the good part then i realized
i started looking and the bubble burst
i started looking for excuses
come on in, i've gotta tell you what a state i'm in
i've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started looking for a warning sign
when the truth is
i miss you
yeah the truth is
that i miss you so
a warning sign
you came back to haunt me and i realized
that you were an island and i passed you by
and you were an island to discover
come on in, i've gotta tell you what a state i'm in
i've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started looking for a warning sign
when the truth is
i miss you
yeah the truth is
that i miss you so
and i'm tired
i should not have let you go
so i crawl back into your open arms
yes i crawl back into your open arms
and i crawl back into your open arms
yes i crawl back into your open arms
how long before i get in?
before it starts, before i begin
how long before you decide?
before i know what it feels like
where to? where do i go?
if you've never tried then you'll never know
how long do i have to climb
up on the side of this mountain of mine?
look up, i look up at night
planets are moving at the speed of light
climb up, up in the trees
every chance that you get is a chance you seize
how long am i gonna stand
with my head stuck under the sand?
i'll stop before i can stop
or before i see things the right way up
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then you'd understand
ideas that you'll never find
or the inventors could never design
the buildings that you put up
or japan and china, all lit up
the sign that i couldn't read
or a light that i couldn't see
some things you have to believe
but others are puzzles, puzzling me
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then you'd understand
oh, when you see it then you'll understand
all those signs i knew what they meant
some things you can't invent
some get made and some get sent, ooh
birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then you'd understand
oh, when you see it then you'll understand
how tides control the sea
and what becomes of me
how little things can slip out of your hands
how often people change
though two remain the same
why things don't always turn out as you plan
these are things that i don't understand
yeah these are things that i don't understand
and i can't decide
oh my wrong from right
or my day from night
or the dark from light
but i love this life
how infinite is space
and who decides your fate
why everything will dissolve into sand
how to avoid defeat
where truth and fiction meet
why nothing ever turns out as you plan
these are things that i don't understand
yeah these are things that i don't understand
and i can't decide
oh my wrong from right
or my day from night
or the dark from light
but i love this life
did i drive you away?
i know what you'll say
you'll say, oh, sing one we know
but i promise you this
i'll always look out for you
yeah that's what i'll do
i say oh
i say oh
my heart is yours
it's you that i hold on to
yeah that's what i do
and i know i was wrong
but i won't let you down
oh yeah, yeah, yeah i will, yes i will
i say oh
i cry oh
yeah i saw sparks
yeah i saw sparks
and i saw sparks
yeah i saw sparks

are you lonesome tonight,
do you miss me tonight?
are you sorry we drifted apart?
does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
when i kissed you and called you sweetheart?
do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
is your heart filled with pain, shall i come back again?
tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
i wonder if you're lonesome tonight
you know someone said that the world's a stage
and each must play a part
fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart
act one was when we met, i loved you at first glance
you read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
and why i'll never know
honey, you lied when you said you loved me
and i had no cause to doubt you
but i'd rather go on hearing your lies
than go on living without you
now the stage is bare and i'm standing there
with emptiness all around
and if you won't come back to me
then make them bring the curtain down
is your heart filled with pain, shall i come back again?
tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
i just got your letter baby
too bad you can't come home
i swear i'm goin' crazy
sittin' here all alone
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
i ain't slept a wink since sunday
i can't eat a thing all day
every day is just blue monday
since you've been away
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
whoops, there goes a teardrop
rollin' down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace
i gotta get myself together
before i lose my mind
i'm gonna catch the next train goin'
and leave my blues behind
since you're gone
whoops, there goes a teardrop
rollin' down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace
i gotta get myself together
before i lose my mind
i'm gonna catch the next train goin'
and leave my blues behind
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
fade
listen easy, you can hear god calling
walking barefoot by the stream
come on to me, your hair's softly falling
on my face as in a dream
and the time will be our time
and the grass won't pay no mind
saying nothing, lying where the sun is
baking down upon our sides
my lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
your hands gentle in reply
and the time will be our time
and the grass won't pay no mind
child, touch my soul with your cries
and the music will know what we've found
i, hear a hundred goodbyes
but today i hear only one sound
the moment we're living is now
now now now now now now now
young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
cools the sweat inside my palms
close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
as you lay sleeping in my arms
and the time will be our time
and the grass won't pay no mind
no the grass won't pay no mind
a little less conversation, a little more action please
all this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me
a little more bite and a little less bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
satisfy me baby
baby close your eyes and listen to the music
dig to the summer breeze
it's a groovy night and i can show you how to use it
come along with me and put your mind at ease
a little less conversation, a little more action please
all this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me
a little more bite and a little less bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
satisfy me baby
come on baby i'm tired of talkin'
grab your coat and let's start walkin'
come on, come on
come on, come on
come on, come on
don't procrastinate, don't articulate
girl it's gettin' late, gettin' upset waitin' around
a little less conversation, a little more action please
all this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me
a little more bite and a little less bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
just close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
satisfy me
satisfy me baby
satisfy me
but now after loving you, what else is there to do
for honey, all the rest is just gonna have to be second best
i know i'll go through life comparing her to you
that's 'cause i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone after loving you
your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
and your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
that's 'cause i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone after loving you
your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
and your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
that's 'cause i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone after loving you
i said i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone after loving you
i said i'm no good, i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone
to anyone, to anyone, to anyone after loving you
that's 'cause i'm no good, i'm no good to anyone after loving you
any day now i will hear you say
goodbye my love
you'll be on your way
then my wild beautiful bird
you will have flown
any day now i'll be all alone
oh, oh, oh
any day now, when your restless eyes
meet someone new
to my sad surprise
then the blue shadow will fall all over town
any day now
love will let me down
oh, oh, oh
i know i shouldn't want to keep you
if you don't want to stay, yeah
until you've gone forever
i'll be holding on for dear life
holding you this way
begging you to stay
any day now
when the clock strikes go
you'll call it off
then my tears will flow
then the blue shadow will fall all over town
any day now
love will let me down
oh, oh, oh
oh, any day now
oh, oh, oh
oh, any day now
don't fly away my beautiful bird
don't fly away my beautiful bird
maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
if i made you feel second best
girl, i'm sorry i was blind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could have
maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should have
you walked into the party
like you were walking onto a yacht
your hat strategically dipped below one eye
your scarf it was apricot
you had one eye in the mirror
as you watched yourself gavotte
and all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
they'd be your partner, and
you're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
you're so vain, i bet you think this song is about you
don't you, don't you?
you had me several years ago
when i was still quite nave
well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
and that you would never leave
but you gave away the things you loved
and one of them was me
i had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
clouds in my coffee, and
you're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
you're so vain, i bet you think this song is about you
don't you, don't you?
i had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
clouds in my coffee, and
you're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
you're so vain, i bet you think this song is about you
don't you, don't you?
well, i hear you went up to saratoga
and your horse, naturally, won
then you flew your lear jet up to nova scotia
to see the total eclipse of the sun
well, you're where you should be all the time
and when you're not you're with some underworld spy
or the wife of a close friend
wife of a close friend
you're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
you're so vain, i bet you think this song is about you
don't you, don't you?
you're so vain
you probably think this song is about you
oh, i wish i was in the land of cotton
old things they are not forgotten
look away, look away, look away dixieland
oh i wish i was in dixie, away, away
in dixieland, i take my stand to live and die in dixie
cause dixieland, that's where i was born
early lord one frosty morning
look away, look away, look away dixieland
glory, glory hallelujah
glory, glory hallelujah
glory, glory hallelujah
his truth is marching on
so hush little baby
don't you cry
you know your daddy's bound to die
but all my trials, lord will soon be over
angel, with those angel eyes
come and take this earth boy
up to paradise
angel, may i hold you tight?
never kissed an angel
let me kiss one tonight
if i said i love you
would i be speaking out of turn?
i'm only human, but i'm willing to learn
angel, make my wish come true
let me be in heaven here on earth with you
angel, never kissed an angel
let me kiss one tonight
if i said i love you
would i be speaking out of turn?
i'm only human, but i'm willing to learn
angel, make my wish come true
let me be in heaven here on earth with you
angel, angel
well a bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
i'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
my friends say i'm actin' wild as a bug
i'm in love
i'm all sup
mm mm mmmmm, yay yay, yeah
well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
i can't seem to stand on my own two feet
who do you thank when you have such luck?
i'm in love
i'm all sup
mm mm, mmmm, yay, yay, yeah
well please don't ask me what's on my mind
i'm a little mixed up, but i feel fine
when i'm near the girl that i love best
my heart beats so, it scares me to death
she touched my hand what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my
buttercup
i'm in love i'm all all sup
mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
my tongue gets tied when i try to speak
my insides shakin' like a leaf on a tree
there's only one cure for this body of mine
that's to have that girl that i love so fine
she touched my hand what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my
buttercup
im in love
i'm all sup
mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
mm mm, mmmmm, yay, yay, yeah
i'm all sup
and i love you so,
the people ask me how,
how i've lived till now
i tell them i don't know
i guess they understand
how lonely life has been
but life began again
the day you took my hand
and yes i know how lonely life can be
shadows follow me
the night won't set me free
but i don't let the evening get me down
now that you're around me
and you love me too
your thoughts are just for me
you set my spirit free
i'm happy that you do
the book of life is brief
once the page is read
all but love is dead
this is my belief
now that the truth is hard to face
i can't forget you once were mine
someone else is in my place
whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
just a little bit of green
clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do
please don't try to tie me down
those are the words you often say
i can't help seeing you around
you smile with surprise, i turn my eyes away
just a little bit of green
ohohho, clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do
ohohohohohoh
just a little bit of green
ohohho, clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do
ohohohohohoh
just a little bit of green
night and you
and blue hawaii
the night is heavenly
and you are heaven to me
lovely you
and blue hawaii
with all this loveliness
there should be love

while the moon is on the sea
the night is young
and so are we, so are we
dreams come true
in blue hawaii
and mine could all come true
this magic night of nights with you
come with me
while the moon is on the sea
the night is young
and so are we, so are we
dreams come true
in blue hawaii
and mine could all come true
this magic night of nights with you
i found my thrill on blueberry hill
on blueberry hill where i found you
the moon stood still on blueberry hill
and lingered until my dreams came true
the wind in the willow played
love's sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be
tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill
the wind in the willow played
love's sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be
tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill
because of love, i'm a hundred feet tall
i can bounce this world like a little old ball
the heaven and earth are now all mine
i've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
because, because, because, because of love
because of love, i'm a mighty big man
i hold the sun in the palm of my hand
just one leap i can cross the seas
jump over mountains and fly over trees
because, because, because, because of love
well i found love, i found love
that's all that i can say
oh i'll never, never, i'll never, never
never let it get away
because of love, i'm the happiest guy
and life is sweet as cherry cream pie
well heaven and earth are now all mine
i've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
because, because, because, because of love
because, because, because, because of love
when you're weary, feeling small
when tears are in your eyes i will dry them all
i'm on your site, oh, when times get rough
and friends just can't be found
like a bridge over troubled water,
i will lay me down,
oh, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
when you're down and out, when you're on the streets
when evening falls so hard, i will comfort you
i'll take your part when the darkness falls and pain is all around
yes, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
oh, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
sail on, silver girl, sail on by
your time has come to shine
all your dreams are on their way

oh, if you need a friend,
i'm sailing right behind
yes, like a bridge over troubled water
i, i will ease your mind
like a bridge over troubled water
i will easy your mind
with eyes that hide the man within
you see behind the eyes of, other men
you've lived and died and come to life again
and now you stand alone at the crossroads of your mind
you've left your yesterdays behind
but which road leads you to tomorrow?
charro
you've turned your back on yesterday
betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay
for when you left you took his pride away
you know he'll never let you break away so easily
you'll have to fight, before you're free
but how much more time can you borrow?
charro
now in a single moment your past grows dim
one thought goes racing across your mind
you ride to meet the woman you stole from him
oh no!charro don't go!
charro don't go!
there's something hanging, in the wind
your past is catching up and closing in
you've been halfway to hell and back again
and now you laugh in the devil's face
with your last breath
you'll run a race with life and death
but will you live to see tomorrow?
charro
all right, hmm

oh danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
from glen to glen and down the mountain side
the summer's gone and all the roses dying
tis you, 'tis you must go and i must bide
but come ye back when summer's in the meadow
or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
and i'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
oh danny boy, oh danny boy i love you so
but if he come and all the roses dying
and i am dead, as dead i well may be
he'll come and find the place where i am lying
and kneel and say an ave there for me
and i shall feel, tho soft you tread above me
and then my grave will richer, sweeter be
for you will bend and tell me that you love me
and i shall rest in peace until you come to me
i walk along a thin line darling
dark shadows follow me
here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
the edge of reality
oh i can hear strange voices echo
laughing with mockery
the border line of doom i'm facing
the edge of reality
on the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
the girl with the nameless face
on the edge of reality where she overpowers me
with fears that i can't explain
she drove me to the point of madness
the brink of misery
if she's not real then i'm condemned to
the edge of reality
on the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
the girl with the nameless face
on the edge of reality where she overpowers me
with fears that i can't explain
she drove me to the point of madness
the brink of misery
if she's not real then i'm condemned to
the edge of reality
reality, reality, reality, reality,
reality, reality, reality, reality
do you know who i am
have you have any idea who i am?
yes, it's been quite a while
and it's so good to see you again
it's so dark in this place
that i can't see your face may believe, oh, i see
does he know who i am
and what once was between you and me?
do you know how i tried
have you any idea how i tried?
not to keep you in sight
do you know, darling, how much i cried?
i remember you said
that you had to forget about me and be free
but do you know who i am
or have you forgot about me?
do you think there's a chance
you and i could start over again?
is there a prayer you still care
or has it just been too long and we're through?
well, what about you and him
oh, he's only a friend, well, i see
there's still a chance for me
well, maybe some other time, in some other place
with our love in your heart and a smile on your face
you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am
you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am
and you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am

fame and fortune
how empty they can be
but when i hold you in my arms
that's heaven to me
who cares for fame and fortune
they're only passing things
but the touch of your lips on mine
makes me feel like a king
your kind of love
is a treasure i hold
it's so much greater
than silver or gold
i know that i have nothing
if you should go away
but to know that you love me
brings fame and fortune my way
before you go walk out on me
take a look around tell me what you see
here i stand like an open book
is there something here you might have overlooked
cause it would be a shame if you should leave
and find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
the years we had were not all bad
in fact i know the good outweighed the bad
now you say that you've grown tired
you want to be by yourself a while
it would be a shame if you should go
and find that freedom was a long time ago
i know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
they just keep on drivin' us apart
you could go where i could never find you
but could you go far enough to get away from your heart
so one more time, for ol' times sake
come and lay your head upon my chest
please don't throw this moment away
we can forget the bad and take the best
if you don't have nothing left to say
let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
if you don't have nothing left to say
let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
you saw me crying in the chapel
the tears i shed were tears of joy
i know the meaning of contentment
now i am happy with the lord
just a plain and simple chapel
where humble people go to pray
i pray the lord that i'll grow stronger
as i live from day to day
i've searched and i've searched
but i couldn't find
no way on earth
to gain peace of mind
now i'm happy in the chapel
where people are of one accord
we gather in the chapel
just to sing and praise the lord
you'll search and you'll search
but you'll never find
no way on earth
to gain peace of mind
take your troubles to the chapel
get down on your knees and pray
your burdens will be lighter
and you'll surely find the way
earth angel, earth angel
will you be mine
my darling dear
love you all the time
i'm just a fool
a fool in love with you
earth angel, earth angel
the one i adore
love you forever and ever more
i'm just a fool
a fool in love with you
i fell for you
and i knew
the vision of your lovloveliness
i hoped and i prayed that someday
that i'd be the vision of your haphappiness
oh, oh,
earth angel, earth angel
please be mine
my darling dear
love you all the time
i'm just a fool
a fool in love with you
i'll pack up all my things and walk away
i don't want to hear another word you have to say
i've been waiting for so long
i just found out there's something wrong
and nothin' will get better if i stay
there's no need to explain anymore
i tried my best to love you, now i'm walking out the door
you used me, you deceived me
and you never seemed to need me
but i'll bet you won't forget me when i go
seems i've been lost in a dream
pretending that you care
and now i've opened up my eyes
and found it's all been just a great big fairytale
i've been lovin' you so long
i don't think i'd even know how to forget you
yeah, the way that things have been
i think i'm better off alone
than to be with you
there's no need to explain anymore
i tried my best to love you, now i'm walking out the door
you used me, you deceived me
and you never seemed to need me
but i'll bet you won't forget me when i go
seems like i've been lost in a dream
pretending that you care
someday you'll open up your eyes
and realize a good man's hard to find
seems like i've been lost in a dream
pretending that you care
and now i've opened up my eyes
and realized a big fairytale
don't look so sad, i know it's over
but life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
there's no need o watch the bridges that we're burning
lay your head upon my pillow
hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time
for the good times
i'll get along, you'll find another
and i'll be here if you should find you ever need me
don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
there'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
lay your head upon my pillow
hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time
for the good times
for the good times

a voice inside my coffeecup
kept crying out
and ringing in my ears

well, i quit my job down at the car wash,
left my mama a goodbye note,
by sundown i'd left kingston,
with my guitar under my coat,
i hitchhiked all the way down to memphis,
got a room at the ymca,
for the next three weeks i went huntin' them night clubs
lookin' for a place to play,
well, i thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
but nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
well, i nearly 'bout starved to death down in memphis,
i run outta money and luck,
so i bought me a ride down to macon, georgia,
on a overloaded poultry truck,
i thumbed on down to panama city,
started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
hopin' i could make myself a dollar,
makin' music on my guitar,
i got the same old story at them all night piers,
there ain't no room around here for a guitar man
so i slept in the hobo jungles,
roamed a thousand miles of track,
till i found myself in mobile alabama,
at a club they call big jack's,
a little fourpiece band was jammin',
so i took my guitar and i sat in,
i showed 'em what a band would sound like,
with a swingin' little guitar man
if you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
find yourself down around mobile,
make it on out to a club called jack's,
if you got a little time to kill,
just follow that crowd of people,
you'll wind up out on his dance floor,
diggin' the finest little fivepiece group,
up and down the gulf of mexico,
guess who's leadin' that fivepiece band,
well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man
well hello there,
my it's been a long long time
how am i doin',
oh well i guess i'm doin' fine
it's been so long now and it seems that
it was only yesterday
mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away
how's your new love,
i hope that he's doin' fine
heard you told him, yes baby
that you'd love him till the end of time
well you know, that's the same thing
that you told me
well it seems like just the other day
mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away
gotta go now,
guess i'll see you hanging round
don't know when though, oh
never know when i'll be back in town
but i remember what i told you
that in time your gonna pay
well ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
frankie and me we were lovers
oh lordy how we could love
swore we'd be true to each other

i was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
my luck in poker was fading
when a new gal caught my eye
i gambled, i tried to change my luck
with a chick named nellie bly
i was frankie's man but i was doing her wrong
yeah! frankie came looking to find me
yes, she wasn't looking for fun
for in her sweet loving hand
she was totin' a 44 gun
to shoot her man if he was doin' her wrong

and right there in front of her eyes
there was her loving johnny
making love to that nellie bly
i was her man, she caught me doing her wrong

the old home town looks the same
as i step down from the train
and there to meet me is my mama and my papa
down the road i look and there runs mary
hair of gold and the lips like cherries
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
yes, they'll all come to meet me
arms reachin', smiling sweetly
oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
the old house is still standing
though the paint is cracked and dry
and there's that old oak tree that i used to play on
yeah, down the lane i'll walk with my sweet mary
hair of gold and the lips like cherries
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
yes, they'll all come to meet me
arms reachin', smiling sweetly
oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
then i awake and look around me
at four gray walls that surround me
and i realize i was only dreamin'
there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
i'll touch the green, green grass of home
yes, they'll all come to see me
in the shade of that old tree
as i lay me in the green, green grass of home
shackled by the heavy burden
neath a load of guilt and shame
then the hand of jesus touched me
he touched me
and now i am no longer the same
for he touched me
oh, he touched me
he touched me
and now all the wonderful joy that floods my soul
something happened and now i know
he touched me and made me whole
oh since i met this blessed savior
and since he cleansed and made me whole,
oh i'm with the saints
with the saints to praise him,
and shout it while eternity rolls
oh, he touched me,
oh, he touched me
he touched me
and all the joy that floods my soul
something happened and now i know
he touched me and made me whole
have i told you lately that i love you?
could i tell you once again somehow?
have i told with all my heart and soul how i adore you?
well darling i'm telling you now
have i told you lately when i'm sleeping
every dream i dream is you somehow?
have i told you why the nights are long
when you're not with me?
well darling i'm telling you now
my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling i'm telling you now
my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling i'm telling you now
it's knowin' that your door is always open
and you path is free to walk
that makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag rolled up
and stashed behind your couch
it's knowin' i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that have dried up on some lovin'
that keeps you in the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
it keeps you ever gentle on my mind
it's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that bind me
or something that somebody said
because they thought we'd fit together walkin'
it's just knowing that the world will not be cursin'
or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're moving on the back roads
by the rivers of my memory and for hours
you're just gentle on my mind
though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junk yards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence
tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me 'till i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you
walking in the back roads
by the rivers flowing gently on my mind
i dip my cup of soup from a gurgling,
cracking cauldron in some train yard
my beard a roughening coal pile
and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands around the tin can
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're wavin' from the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
how the web was woven
in my soul, don't you know
how the web was woven
can't get loose, can't let go
like the weave of a spider
wound around my heart
i'm no longer free
at last i'm where you want me
don't you know, that's where i want to be?
spinning 'round like a blue fly
thoughts of you fill my head
and no matter, oh how i try
i can't sleep in my bed
i've been round for the last time
oh, girl, what can i do?
oh the time the web was woven,
how i fell in love, fell in love with you

thy power throughout the universe displayed
then sings my soul, my savior god, to thee
how great thou art, how great thou art!
then sings my soul! my savior god, to thee
how great thou art, how great thou art!
when through the woods and forest glades i wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze
then sings my soul, my savior god, to thee
how great thou art, how great thou art!
then sings my soul! my savior god, to thee
how great thou art, how great thou art!
and when i think that god, his son not sparing,
sent him to die, i scarce can take it in
that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
he bled and died to take away my sin
then sings my soul, my savior god, to thee
how great thou art, how great thou art!

how great thou art, how great thou art!
when christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!

if only in my dreams

i'll miss you and i can stay a while
you'll see it in my eyes and when i smile
if i get home before midnight
while you're still sleeping tight
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day
writing letters everyday
never really seem to say
the way i feel deep in this heart of mine
thought i'm half a world away
if we're patient and we pray
know i'll get my chance with you this time
if i get home on christmas day
i won't need soft words to say
i'll miss you and i can stay a while

if i get home before midnight
while you're still sleeping tight
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day
on the hills of georgia
across the plains of tennessee
i've seen and i've done most everything
that a man can do or see
but if i could only borrow one dream from your sleep
i'd be on that train tomorrow
i'll be home on christmas day
and so many times before
she left that candle burning
oh, too many tears fell
my soul fills with yearning
if i had sense at all
i'd just be on my way
be on that train tomorrow
be home on christmas day
everytime i think about her
all the love i left behind
memories still linger in my troubled mind
i could set aside my pride
and i'd be on my way
i'd catch that train tomorrow
and be home on christmas day
if i had any sense at all
i'd just be on my way
i'd catch that train tomorrow
i'd be home on christmas day
i said i'd catch that train tomorrow
i'd be home on christmas day
the sandman comes to my house late each night
but it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
it's times like this my darling i can see
if i were you i'd know that i love me
the great snowman i've been called by all
but it looks like this time i'm gonna fall
it's times like this my darling i can see
oooh if i were you i'd know that i love me
wind and rain and storm closin' in on me
i've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
can you hear me saying hopefully
oooh if i were you i'd know that i love me
wind and rain and storm closin' in on me
i've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
can you hear me saying hopefully
if i were you i'd know that i love me
oooh if i were you i'd know that i love me
if i were you i'd know that i love me
lying by your side i watch you sleepin'
and in your face the sweetness of a child
murmuring the dream you won't recapture
though it will haunt the corners of your mind
oh, i've lost you
though you're near me
and your body's still as kind
i've lost you on the journey
but i can't remember where or when
who can tell when summer turns to autumn
and who can point the moment love grows cold
softly without pain the joy is over
though why it's gone we' neither of us know
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but reason can't stand in for feeling low
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but reason can't stand in for feeling
six o'clock the baby will be crying
and you will stumble, sleeping to the door
in the chill and sun gray of morning
we play the parts that we have learned too well
oh, i've lost you, i've lost you
oh you won't admit it so
i've lost you on the journey
but i can't remember where or when oh love
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but the reason can't stand in for feeling low
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but reason can't stand in
i may not be here tomorrow
but i'm close beside you today
so lie to me a little, say you love me a lot
and i'll be true to you in my way
love never goes on forever
at least that's what wise men all say
so smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry
but i'll be true to you in my way
yes i'll be true to you in my way
as the snow flies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
a poor little baby child is born
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
cause if there's one thing that she don't need
it's another hungry mouth to feed
in the ghetto
people, don't you understand
the child needs a helping hand
or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
take a look at you and me
are we too blind to see
do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way
well the world turns
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto
and his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal
and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto
then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away
he buys a gun, steals a car
tries to run, but he don't get far
and his mama cries
as a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
face down on the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto
as her young man dies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
i will be true
no matter what they may say
i will be true
although you're far far away
each night i pray
all day i'll say a silent prayer
that when i open my door
i'll find you there
somehow i feel
that someday we'll meet again
don't ask me how
it's something i can't explain
until the day
i give up all hope of you
assure yourself this i'll do
i will be true
oh oh mmmmmmm
that someday we'll meet again
don't ask me how
it's something i can't explain
until the day
i give up all hope of you
assure yourself this i'll do
i will be true
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be
they're saying i am just your clown,
and any fool could see,
that you're just having fun,
and you're not in love with me,
the things they're saying maybe true,
but there's something they can't see
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be
if i'm a dreamer let me dream,
if i'm your clown i'll steal the show,
if things are not the way they seem,
please don't ever let me know
if i am blind it's because,
i just don't want to see,
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be
if i'm a dreamer let me dream,
if i'm your clown i'll steal the show,
if things are not the way they seem,
please don't ever let me know
if i am blind it's because,
i just don't want to see,
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be,
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be,
if i'm a fool for loving you,
then that's just what i want to be
you came when i was happy in your sunshine
i grew to love you more each passing day
before too long i'd filled my world around you
yeah and i prayed, you love enough of me to stay
if you love me let me know
if you don't let me go
i can't take another minute of the day without you near
if you love me let it be
if you don't set me free
oh, take the chains away that keep me loving you
the arms that open wide to hold me closer
the hands that run their fingers through my hair
the smile that says 'hello it's good to see you'
any time i turn around and find you there
it's this and so much more that makes me love you
now what else can i do to make you see long, long?
you know you'll have whatever's mine to give you
yeah but love affair for one it never be
if you love me let me know
if you don't let me go
i can't take another minute of the day without you near
if you love me let it be
if you don't set me free
oh take the chains away that keep me loving you
oh take the chains away that keep me loving you
loving you
he left the splendor of heaven
knowing his destiny
was the lonely hill of golgotha
there to lay down his life for me
and if that isn't love
then the ocean is dry
there's no stars in the sky
and the little sparrows can't fly
yeah, if that isn't love
then heaven's a myth
there's no feeling like this
if that isn't love
even in death he remembered
the thief hanging by his side
then he spoke of love and compassion
and he took him to paradise
and if that isn't love
then the ocean is dry
there's no stars in the sky
and the little sparrows can't fly, ohh
yeah, if that isn't love
then heaven's a myth
there's no feeling like this
if that isn't love, it's got to be love
i said i'd hold, i said i'd hold,
i said i'd hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
like you've never been held before
well i'll think of you each day and then i'll dream the night away
oh, 'till you are in my arms once more
the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
i feel so blue 'cause i'm away from you
yeah i'll hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
oh darling please wait for me
you know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
i feel so blue 'cause i'm away, i'm away from you
yeah i'll hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
oh darling please wait for me
the stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why
i feel so blue 'cause i'm away, i'm away, i'm away, i'm away from you
i said, i said i'd hold you in my heart, heart, heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
oh darling please wait for me
the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
i, i feel so blue 'cause i'm away, i'm away from you
yeah, i'll hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
oh darling please wait for me
i know you're a lonely woman and i love you
but someone else is waiting and he owns you
if he should ever wake up, make sure that your story is straight love
if you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
and if you walk in your sleep forget where you came
walking every night here in the shadows
so afraid that sometime he may follow
there's always the chance he'll find us
i don't need to remind you
if you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
if you walk in your sleep forget where you came
love is so much sweeter when it's borrowed
i'll feel a little easier tomorrow
don't give our secret away, be careful what you say
if you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
if you walk in your sleep forget where you came
forget where you came, now
forget where you came
don't mention my name
don't mention my name
forget where you came
there must be lights burning brighter somewhere
got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
if i can dream of a better land
where all my brothers walk hand in hand
tell me why, oh why, oh why
can't my dream come true oh why?
there must be peace and understanding sometime
strong winds of promise that will blow away
the doubt and fear, if i can dream of a warmer sun
where hope keeps shining on everyone
tell me why, oh why, oh why
won't that sun appear?
we're lost in a cloud, with too much of rain
we're trapped in a world, that's troubled with pain
but as long as a man, has the strength to dream
he can redeem his soul and fly
deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
still i am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
and while i can think, while i can talk
while i can stand, while i can walk
while i can dream, please let my dream
come true right now, let it come true right now oh yeah
la la la
la la la
la la la
la la la
well, i know, if i arrive in time to know you
if you had taken the time to show me
i wouldn't be lonely
where will i go? who will i have to lie beside me?
to ease this emptiness inside me
i'm, i'm so lonely
tried so hard each time, each time i just can't make it
feelin' fast vibrations and i just can't take it
living from day to day, chasing the dream
i'm, i'm leavin'
la la la
la la la
tried so hard each time, each time i just can't make it
feelin' fast vibrations and i just can't take it
living from day to day, chasing the dream
i'm, i'm leavin'
la la la
la la la
la la la
la la la
i'm, i'm leavin'
la la la

i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the song of god discloses
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known
he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known
i'll remember you
long after this endless summer is gone
i'll be lonely, oh so lonely
living only to remember you
i'll remember you
your voice as soft
as the warm summer breeze
your sweet laughter, mornings after
ever after, i'll remember you
to your arms someday
i'll return to stay till then
i will remember too
every bright star we made wishes upon
love me always, promise always
ooo, you'll remember too
to your arms someday
i'll return to stay till then
i will remember too
every bright star we made wishes upon
love me always, promise always
ooo, you'll remember too
i'll remember you
i said i'd hold, i said i'd hold,
i said i'd hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms
like you've never been held before
well i'll think of you each day and then i'll dream the night away
oh, 'till you are in my arms once more
the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
i feel so blue 'cause i'm away from you
yeah i'll hold you in my heart 'till i can hold you in my arms

oh darling please wait for me
i've been in love so many times
i thought i knew the score
now you've treated me so wrong
i can't take any more
and it looks like i'm never gonna fall in love again
fall in love, i'm never gonna fall in love
i mean it, i mean it, fall in love again
i gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride
when i saw you in his arms baby
i broke up and cried
and it looks like i'm never gonna fall in love again
that's what i'm sayin' fall in love, no, i'm never gonna fall in love
please don't make me fall in love again
that's why i, no, i'm never gonna fall in love
please don't make me, don't make me, fall in love again
baby don't fall in love with me
i'll only bring you grief
baby, don't set your heart on me
i'll only have to leave
cause the north wind flows through my veins
like my dad there's a dream in my brain
in the morning i'll have to leave again
that's how it is when you inherit the wind
inherit the wind
daddy, he was a traveling man
i hardly knew his face
momma, she cried for him at night
he never stayed in one place
cause the north wind flows through my veins
like my dad there's a dream in my brain
in the morning i'll have to leave again
that's how it is when you inherit the wind
inherit the wind
oh i can't give you the love you need
i just won't be here that long
but if you still want me here tonight
i'll love you till the break of dawn
cause the north wind flows through my veins
like my dad there's a dream in my brain
in the morning i'll have to leave again
that's how it is when you inherit the wind
inherit the wind
inherit the wind, inherit the wind
it's impossible to tell the sun to leave the sky,
it's just impossible
it's impossible to ask a baby not to cry,
it's just impossible
can i hold you closer to me
and not feel you going through me,
but the second that i never think of you?
oh, how impossible
can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
it's just impossible
if i had you could i ever ask for more?
it's just impossible
and tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
somehow i'd get it, i would sell my very soul
and not regret it for to live without your love
is just impossible
can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
it's just impossible
if i had you could i ever ask for more?
it's just impossible
and tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
somehow i'd get it, i would sell my very soul
and not regret it for to live without your love
is just impossible
oh impossible,
impossible
impossible
god bless
the day i found you
i want to
stay around you
and so i beg you
let it be me
don't take
this heaven from one
if you must
cling to someone
now and forever
let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love
tell me, what would life be?
so never
leave me lonely
just tell me
you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
oh, without your sweet love
tell me, what would life be?
so never
leave me lonely
just tell me
you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me
and that you'll always
let it be me
so never
leave me lonely
just tell me
you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me

maybe it's too late
sometimes even hate myself
for loving you
trying to be strong
then night time comes along
and i start loving you, wanting you
where is all my self control?
i'm burning way down in my soul
and needing you
wishing i could be the man i try to
hating me for wanting to be with you
knowing you don't love me like you used to
but it's midnight, oh, and i miss you
it's getting late and i know
that's when i am weak
funny how things have a way
of looking so much brighter in the daylight
i hope to go to bed
and try to straighten out my head
and just forget you
oh, but it's midnight and i miss you
it's getting late and i know
that's when i am weak
funny how things have a way
of looking so much brighter in the daylight
i hope to go to bed
and try to straighten out my head
and just forget you
oh, but it's midnight and i miss you
it's midnight and i miss you
it's a matter of time before i go back there
a matter of time before i go home
i have been way from her now for a long time
and i've lived a life i thought that it should be
it's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
and the waiting round is really killing me
it's a matter of time before i go back there
a matter of time oh lord, before i go home
it's a long way i know and the goin' ain't easy
she'll see me again it's a matter of time
i think i'll take a train right early in the morning
just to see how far i get along the way
but the trains don't run too often only sometimes
so i guess i'd better wait another day
it's a matter of time before i go back there
a matter of time before i go home
it's a long way i know and the goin' ain't easy
she'll see me again, it's just a matter of time
she'll see me i know it's a matter of time
it's now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
my love won't wait
when i first saw you
with your smile so tender
my heart was captured
my soul surrendered
i'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
now that your near
the time is here at last
it's now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
my love won't wait
just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
if we lost true love
and sweet devotion
your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
for who knows when
we'll meet again this way
it's now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
my love won't wait
it's now or never
my love won't wait
i cry myself to sleep each night
wishing i could hold you tight
life seems so empty since you went away
and the pillow where you lay your head
now holds my empty dreams instead
and it keeps right on ahurtin'
since you're gone
it keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
every hour you're away i feel so lonely
and i can't help it, i don't think i can go on
and it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
they say a man ain't supposed to cry
but when i see you passing by
my heart breaks down and cries a million tears
the pillow where you lay your head
now holds my empty dreams instead
and it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
it keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
every hour you're away i feel so lonely
and i can't help it, i don't think i can go on
and it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
yes, it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
as the snow flies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
a poor little baby child is born
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
cause if there's one thing that she don't need
it's another hungry mouth to feed
in the ghetto
people, don't you understand
the child needs a helping hand
or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
take a look at you and me
are we too blind to see
do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way
well the world turns
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto
and his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal
and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto
then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away
he buys a gun, steals a car
tries to run, but he don't get far
and his mama cries
as a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
face down on the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto
as her young man dies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
i reached out one night and you were gone
don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
all i know is i want to bring you home
so i'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
on this lonely kentucky back road
i've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
to let you go, never knowing what went wrong
kentucky rain keeps pouring down
and up ahead's another town that i'll go walking through
with the rain in my shoes
searching for you
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
showed your photograph to some old graybearded men
sitting on a bench outside a general store
they said, yes, she's been here
but their memory wasn't clear
was it yesterday?
no, wait, the day before
finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?
as we drove on through the rain, as he listened, i explained
and he left me with a prayer that i'd find you
kentucky rain keeps pouring down
and up ahead's another town that i'll go walking through
with the rain in my shoes
searching for you
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
in the cold kentucky rain
oh, it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
far too many miles are between
but if i get the one thing i'm wishing for
well then i'll see you tonight in my dreams
seems a long time since we've been together
it was just about to this time of year
looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
how i wish that you could be here
but it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
far too many miles are between
but if i get the one thing that i'm wishing for
then i'll see you tonight in my dreams
in the distance i hear sleigh bells ringing
the holly is so pretty this year
and the carol that somebody's singing
reminds me of our christmas last year
oh but it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
far too many miles are between
oh, but if i get the one thing that i'm wishing for
then i'll see you tonight in my dreams
yes i'll see you tonight in my dreams
it hurts me to see him treat you the way he does
it hurts me to see sit and cry
when i know i could be so true
if i had someone like you
it hurts me to see those tears in your eyes
the whole town is talking, they're callin' you a fool
for listening to his same old lies
and when i know i could be so true
if i had someone like you
it hurts me to see the way he makes you cry
you love him too much, you're too blind to see
he's only playing a game
but he's never loved you
he never will
and darling, don't you know he will never change
oh, i know he never will set you free
because he's just that kind of guy
but if you ever tell him you're through
i'll be waiting for you
waiting to hold you so tight
waiting to kiss you goodnight
yes, darling, if i had someone like you
just pretend, i'm holding you
and whispering things soft and low
and think of me, how it's gonna be,
just pretend i didn't go
when i walked away, i heard you say
if you need me, you know what to do
if knew it then, i'd be back again
just pretend i'm right there with you
and i'll come flying to you, again
all the crying is through
oh, i will hold you and love you again
but until then, well just pretend
oh, it's funny but i can't recall the things
we said or why you cry
but now i know it was wrong to go
i belong here by your side
and i'll come flying to you, again
all my crying is true
oh, i will hold you and love you again
but until then, well just pretend
i will hold you and love you again
but until then, well just pretend
kiss me quick, while we still have this feeling
hold me close and never let me go
cause tomorrows can be so uncertain
love can fly and leave hurting
kiss me quick because i love you
kiss me quick and make my heart go grazy
sight that sigh and whisper oh so low
tell me that tonight will last forever
say that you will leave me never
kiss me quick because i love you so
let the band keep playing while we are swaying
let's keep on praying that we'll never stop
keep me quick i just can't stand this waiting
cause you lips are lips i long to know
for that kiss will open heaven's door
and well stay there
forever more
kiss me quick because i love you so
let the band keep playing while we are swaying
lets keep on praying that we'll never stop
kiss me quick i just can't stand this waiting
cause your lips are lips i long to know
for that kiss will open heaven's door
and stay there forever more
kiss me quick because i love you
well, well, well,
just because you think you're so pretty,
and just because your momma thinks you're hot,
well, just because you think you've got something
that no other girl has got,
you've caused me to spend all my money
you laughed and called me old santa claus
well, i'm telling you,
baby, i'm through with you
because, well well, just because
well, well, well,
there'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
and there'll come a time when you'll be blue
well, there'll come a time when old santa
he won't pay your bills for you
you've caused me to lose all my women
and now, now you say we are through
well, i'm telling you
baby, i was through with you
a long long time ago
well, just because you think you're so pretty
and just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in
town
well, just because you think you've got something
that nobody else has got,
you've caused me to spend all of my money
honey, you laughed and called me your old santa claus
well, i'm telling you i'm through with you
because, well well, just because
look at you and tell myself
how wonderful you are
you're so different now
to me you're much more wonderful, more wonderful by far
yes, you're different now
there's more to love than holding hands and stealing kisses
noone else around
there's the good times and the bad
there's the ups and downs we've had
but it's different now i'm so glad i still have you
there's always something new to see
i look at you, you look at me
and we're so different now
love gets better every day 'n in some peculiar way
it's always different now
if we ever say goodbye, you'd be lost
and so would i, what's the difference now between us
love just for a day, and a love that's here to stay
that's the difference now, the difference now
the chimes of time ring out the news,
another day is through
someone slipped and fell
was that someone you?
you may have longed for added strength,
your courage to renew
do not be disheartened,
for i have news for you
it is no secret what god can do
what he's done for others, he'll do for you
with arms wide open, he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do
there is no night for in his light
you never walk alone
always feel at home,
wherever you may go
there is no power can conquer you
while god is on your side
take him at his promise,
don't run away and hide
it is no secret what god can do
what he's done for others, he'll do for you
with arms wide open, he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do

i need you so, i need you so
the day i found i am alive
then i broke down and cried like a baby
well it was then i could see
you were playing with me like a baby
well you can bet that some day
i'll forget just like a baby
i used to laugh when i should cry
i used to let these feelings pass me by
but now that i believe them
i got noone to leave them to me
you see i traded love for what i thought must be free
so i confess my loneliness
and i guess i've lost the best of the year
that i have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
if i cared i wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
i know the time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear
cos' i don't want to write
another love song of the year
it's a lonely song and not too clear
but to me it's very dear
i guess this song can only be
my feelings went out in the sea of love
to me this has got to be the love song of the year
i know the time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear
cos' i don't want to write
another love song of the year
i used to laugh i used to cry
i used to laugh, these feelings passed me by
from now on i'll make it very clear cos' i don't want to write
another love song of the year
i'm satisfied with just a cottage below
a little silver and a little gold
but in that city where the ransomed will shine
i want a gold one that's silver lined
i've got a mansion just over the hilltop
in that bright land where we'll never grow old
and some day yonder we will never more wander
but walk on streets that are purest gold
don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
i'm not discouraged i'm heaven bound
i'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
i want a mansion, a harp and a crown
i've got a mansion just over the hilltop
in that bright land where we'll never grow old
and some day yonder we will never more wander
but walk on streets that are purest gold
well, it's hard to be a gambler
bettin' on the number
that changes ev'ry time
well, you think you're gonna win
think she's givin' in
a stranger's all you find
yeah, it's hard to figure out
what she's all about
but she's woman through and through
she's a complicated lady
so color my baby moody blue
oh, moody blue
tell me am i gettin' through
i keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
but i never do
oh, moody blue
tell me who i'm talkin' to
you're like the night and day and it's hard to say
which one is you
well, when monday comes she's tuesday
when tuesday comes she's wednesday
into another day again
her personality unwinds
just like a ball of twine
on a spool that never ends
just when i think i know her well
her emotions reveal
she's not the person that i though i knew
she's a complicated lady
so color my baby moody blue
oh, moody blue
tell me am i gettin' through
i keep hangin' on, try to learn the song

over promises that i made
but for the first time in my life
i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i'd do if you go away
this would sure be one lonely old town
for a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me
love's all that matters to you
and looking back now, wondering how i believed
i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you
like some fool on a merrygoround
and that a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love going down
love going down
can't you see how everything i've learned
would just be wasted if you leave me
if you just give one more try
i swear i'll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to forgive me
i'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
but if a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down

oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life i lead
need the things i need, don't try to change me
if you're gonna take me, take me for what i am
i can't be another man, i can't be free
cos the life i lead is the life i lead
money in my pocket never seems to last too long
i've gambled on the way and drowned my sorrows

if you could see me now
the one who said that he'd rather roam
the one who said he'd rather be alone
if you could only see me now
if i could hold you now
just for a moment if i could really make you mine
just for a while turn back the hands of time
if i could only hold you now
i've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
taking any comfort that i can
looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
and lying in your loving arms again
if you could hear me now
singing somewhere in the lonely night
dreaming of the arms that held me tight
if you could only hear me now
oh i've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
taking any comfort that i can
looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
and lying in your loving arms again
i can almost feel your loving arms again
i went and bought myself a ticket and i sat down in the very first row
they pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low
little egypt came out astruttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow
singing, yingying, yingying, yingying, yingying
she had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as texas on her toe
she let her hair down and she did the hoochiecoochie real slow
when she did her special number on the zebra skin i thought she'd stop the show
singing, yingying, yingying, yingying, yingying
she did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
she winked at the audience and then she turned around
she had a picture of a cowboy tatooed on her spine
said, phoenix, arizona 1949
yeh, let me tell you people little egypt doesn't dance there anymore
she's too busy mopping and atakin' care of shopping at the store
cos we've got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor
singing yingying, yingying, yingying, yingying
it's a lonely man
who wanders all around
it's a lonely man
who roams from town to town
searchin', always searchin'
for something he can't find
hopin', always hopin'
that some day fate will be kind
it's a lonely man
who travels all alone
when he has no one
that he can call his own
always so unhappy
taking shelter where he can
here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man
always so unhappy
taking shelter where he can
here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man
here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man
nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
when through a sleepy haze i see her lying there
soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
warm as the sunlight shining on her golden hair
when i awake and see her there so close beside me
i want to take her in my arms,
the ache is there so deep inside me
nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
chasing a rainbow in her dreams so far away
and when she turns to touch it i kiss her face so softly
and then my mary wakes to love another day
and mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather
she doesn't care, cause right or wrong the love we share,
we share together
nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the evening
kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair
and as we walk, i hold her close beside me
all our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
and mary's there, and mary's there and mary's there
oh, mama liked the roses she grew them in the yard
but winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
she'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
when i hear the sunday bells ringing in the morning
i remember crying when she used to sing
oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
about the way we learned to live
and if we said our prayers
you know i kept the family bible
with a rose that she saved inside
it was pressed between the pages
like it had found a place to hide
oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
we bring them every mother's day
and put them on her grave
oh, mama liked the roses mmmm
mama liked the roses
if you could see me now
the one who said that he would rather roam
the one who said he'd rather be alone
if you could only see me now
if i could hold you now
just for a moment, if i could really make you mine
just for a while turn back the hands of time
if i could only hold you now
cause i've been too long in the wind
too long in the rain
takin' any comfort that i can
looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
and lying in your lovin' arms again
if you could hear me now
singin' somewhere in the lonely night
dreaming of the arms that hold me tight
if you could only hear me now
cause i've been too long in the wind
too long in the rain
takin' any comfort that i can
looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
and lying in your lovin' arms again
i can almost feel your lovin' arms again

you know, the landlord rang my front door bell
i let it ring for a long, long spell
i went to the window,
i peeped through the blind,
and asked him to tell me what's on his mind
he said,
money, honey
money, honey
money, honey, if you want to get along with me
well, i screamed and i hollered,

money, honey
money, honey
money, honey,
if you want to get a long with me
well, i've learned my lesson and now i know
the sun may shine and the winds may blow
the women may come and the women may go,
but before i say i love you so,
i want
money, honey
money, honey
money, honey,
if you want to get along with me

oh little town of bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
for christ is born of mary, and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth
and praises sing to god the king, and peace to men on earth
oh little town of bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
one night with you
is what i? m now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true
just call my name
and i? ll be right by your side
i want your sweet helping hand
my love's too strong to hide
always lived very quiet life
i ain? t never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
is being too lonely, too long
one night with you
is what i? m now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true
always lived very quiet life
i ain? t never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
is being too lonely, too long
one night with you
is what i? m now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true
and now the end is near
so i face the final curtain
my friend, i'll say it clear
i'll state my case of which i'm certain
i've lived a life that's full
i've traveled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way
regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
and saw it through without exception
i planned each charted course
each careful step along the byway
oh, and more, much more than this
i did it my way
yes, there were times, i'm sure you know
when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and i stood tall
and did it my way
i've loved, i've laughed and cried
i've had my fails, my share of losing
and now as tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that
and may i say, not in a shy way
oh, no, no not me
i did it my way
for what is a man, what has he got
if not himself, then he has not
to say the words he truly feels
and not the words he would reveal
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
one night of sin, yeah
is what i'm now paying for
the things i did and i saw
would make the earth stand still
don't call my name
it makes me feel so ashamed
i lost my sweet helping hand
i got myself to blame
always lived very quiet life
ain't never did no wrong
now i know that very quiet life
has cost me nothing but harm
one night of sin, yeah
is what i'm now paying for
the things i did and i saw
would make the earth stand still
always lived very quiet life
ain't never did no wrong
but now i know that very quiet life
has cost me nothing but harm
one night of sin
is what i'm now paying for
the things i did and i saw
would make the earth stand still

because you're all i have, my boy

because you're all i have, my boy
you are my life, my pride, my joy
and if i stay, i stay because of you, my boy

when you looked into my eyes
i stood there like i was hypnotised
you sent a feeling to my spine
a feeling warm and smooth and fine
but all i could do were stand there paralyzed
when we kissed, ooh what a thrill
you took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
i felt like grabbin' you real tight
squeeze and squeeze with all my might
but all i could do was stand there paralyzed
oh yeah lucky me, i'm singing ev'ry day, oooh

o come, all ye faithful
joyful and triumphant
o come ye, o come ye to bethlehem
come and behold him
born the king of angels
o come, let us adore him
o come, let us adore him
o come, let us adore him
christ the lord
sing, choirs of angels
sing in exaltation
oh sing, all ye bright hosts
of heaven above
glory to god, glory in the highest
o come, let us adore him
o come, let us adore him
o come, let us adore him
christ the lord
oh, little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
oh, morning stars together
proclaim thy holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
oh, little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
my warped and worried mind resorts,
to wandering off to ponder things i never talked about,
a pretty girl i used to know,
but wouldn't know if we met face to face,
and defying every logic known,
i wish the time machine could take me back again,
to the wonder of my first love,
the old folks teased me 'bout,
referring to her only as my little friend
somewhere far away and maybe not so far away,
a child has grown into a woman of the world,
i assumed this knowing that she knew,
so much of life at such a tender age,
i learned from her the whisped things,
the big boys at the pool hall talked about,
the thrill and disappointment fear and shame,
that first love brings,
but oh how i thought i loved my little friend
the fragrance of the green grass,
mingled with the scent of love and womanhood,
a moonlight night i kissed and cried,
and swore i'd never touch another girl,
but time moved fast and i moved on,
and i loved others time and time again,
but with each time i thought of her,
and always gave a little more,
a symbol of remembrance for my little friend,
a symbol of remembrance for my little friend,
a symbol of remembrance for my little friend
a water glass full of whiskey
women that i never knew too well
lord, the things i've seen and done
most of which i'd be ashamed to tell
i don't know how it started
that's what makes a man a man, i guess
now i'm holdin' on to nothin'
tryin' to forget the rest
i'm lookin' back on my life
to see if i can find the pieces
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well, i've found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but i guess, i threw the best parts away
lord, away, away
playing the bars, playing like a star
anything to get a name
carryin' on, livin' on songs
my friends wrote for me to sing
i'm lookin' back on my life
to see if i can find the pieces
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well, i've found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but i guess, i threw the best parts away
away, away
lord, the pieces of my life
they're everywhere, they're everywhere
and the one i miss most of all
is you and you know who
lookin' back on my life, lord
to see if i can find the pieces
lookin' back on my life today
to see if i can find the pieces
lookin' back on my life
god, help me find the pieces
midnights prayers so softly whispered in
a cathedral's candle light
bring the message of the holidays
on a snowy christmas night
holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
symbols of the seasons might
joyful faces everywhere you go
on a snowy christmas night
give thanks for all you've been blessed with
and hold your loved ones tight
for you know the lord's been good to you
on a snowy christmas night
mother nature wears a bridal gown
for the world is dressed in white
there's a silent glow that fills the earth
on a snowy christmas night
for you know the lord's been good to you
on a snowy christmas night
well so long
oh how i hate to see you go
yes so long
oh how i hate to see you go
well the way that i will miss you
i guess you'll never know
we've been together so long
to have to separate this way
we've been together so long
to have to separate this way
well i'm gonna let you go ahead on baby
but let you come back home some day
play the blues boys, play the blues
one more time
you said you once had loved me
but now i guess you've changed your mind
you said you once had loved me
but now i guess you've changed your mind

so prove your love is true
she'll be there to say i do
and if you go o'er sea or land
she'll make you understand
while you're gone oh try to believe
her love for you is really for real
it's written in the book
that she was meant for only you
so prove your love is true

i see a change is coming to our lives
it's not the same as it used to be
and it's not too late to realise our mistake
we're just not right for each other
love has slipped away left us only friends
we almost seem like strangers
all that's left between us are the memories we shared
of times we thought we cared for each other
there's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
and pick up all the pieces left behind us
and maybe someday, somewhere along the way
another love will find us
maybe she will understand
why her mom and dad are not together
the tears that she will cry when
some day when she's older, i have to say goodbye

there's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
and pick up all the pieces left behind us
and maybe someday, somewhere along the way
another love will find us

it was a night oooo what a night

the moon was bright oh how so bright
it was it really was such a night
the night was alight with stars above
oooo when she kissed me
i had to fall in love
oh it was a kiss oooo what a kiss
it was it really was such a kiss
oh how she could kiss oh what a kiss
it was it really was such a kiss
just the thought of her lips
sets me afire
i reminisce and i'm filled with desire
but i'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
how well i remember, i'll always remember
oh, what a night oooo what a night
it was it really was such a night
came the dawn and my heart and her love
and the night was gone
but i'll never forget the kiss
the kiss in the moonlight

but i'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
how well i remember, i'll always remember

came the dawn, dawn, dawn
and my love was gone
but before that dawn
yes before that dawn and before that dawn
oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo
such a night
the clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night
i lie in the darkness thinking i must go before it's light
before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay
i'll leave 'cause i can't stand to see you hurt this way
sleep my love as i kiss you goodbye
then i won't hear the sound of your cry
though i knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow
i just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how
i know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
but if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart
sleep my love as i kiss you goodbye
then i won't hear the sound of your cry
sleep my love as i kiss you goodbye
then i won't hear the sound of your cry
ohhhh, sleep my love as i kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye
then i won't hear the sound of your cry
ohhhh, sleep my love as i kiss you
summer kisses, winter tears
that was what she gave to me
never thought that i'd travel all alone
the trail of memories
happy hours, lonely years
but i guess i can't complain
for i still recall the summer sun
through all the winter rain
the fire of love, the fire of love
can burn from afar
and nothing can light the dark of the night
like a falling star
summer kisses, winter tears
like the stars they fade away
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday
the fire of love, the fire of love
can burn from afar
and nothing can light the dark of the night
like a falling star
summer kisses, winter tears
like the stars they fade away
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday
summer kisses, winter tears
yesterday, i slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
of a perfect day and the next step is love
the next step is love
we walked barefoot through the misty meadows
laughing at each other in the rain
made some faces at some people in the park
and didn't bother to explain
fun, fun, look at us run
going nowhere special really fast
but we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
that we've been baking with the past
and the next step is love
so what are we waiting for?
the next step is love
girl, it's for sure
yesterday, i slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
of a perfect day and the next step is love
next step is love
love will be a place to run to
from the world they've willed to you and me
we'll be closer than we've ever been
though looking back it's so hard to believe
hang it all out, we're bringing all in
the best we've picked upon the way tonight
changes are coming but together
we can make it through somehow
cause the next step is love
so what are we waiting for?
yeah, the next step is love
girl, it's for sure
yesterday, i slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
of a perfect day and the next step is love
the next step is love
yes, it is love
next step is love
yes, it's love
next step is love
yes girl it's love

precious lord, take my hand
lead me on, let me stand
i'm tired, i'm weak, i'm lone
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand, precious lord
lead me home
when my way grows drear
precious lord, linger near
when my light is almost gone
hear my cry, hear my call
hold my hand, lest i fall
take my hand precious lord
lead me home
when the darkness appears
and the night draws near
and the day is past and gone
at the river, i stand
guide my feet, hold my hand
take my hand precious lord
lead me home
precious lord, take my hand
lead me on, let me stand
i'm tired, i'm weak, i'm lone
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand precious lord
lead me home
to dream the impossible dream
to fight the unbeatable foe
to bear with unbearable sorrow
to run where the brave dare not go
to right the unrightable wrong
to love pure and chaste from afar
to try when your arms are too weary
to reach the unreachable star
this is my quest, to follow that star
no matter how hopeless,
no matter how far
to fight for the right
without question or pause
to be willing to march into hell
for a heavenly cause
and i know if i'll only be true
to this glorious quest
that my heart will lie peaceful and calm
when i'm laid to my rest
and the world would be better for this
that one man scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star
she loves me, she loves me not
she loves me, she loves me not
she loves me, she loves me, she loves me
the lady loves me and it shows
in spite of the way she turns up her nose
i'm her ideal, her hearts desire
under that ice she's burning like fire
she'd like to cuddle up to me
she's playing hard to get
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
the gentleman has savoirfaire
as much as an elephant or a bear
i'd like to take him for a spin
back to the zoo to visit his kin
he's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
the lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
the lady's got a crush on me
the gentleman's crazy obviously
the lady's dying to be kissed
the gentleman needs a psychiatrist
i'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
or play russian roulette
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
she's falling fast she's on the skids
both of his heads are flipping their lids
tonight she'll hold me in her arms
i'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
will someone tell this romeo
i'm not his juliet
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
she wants me
like poison ivy
needs me
like a hole in the head
everyone can see she's got it bad
he's mad!
the gentleman is an egotist
i'm simply aware i'm hard to resist
he's one man i could learn to hate
how's about having dinner at eight
i'd rather dine with frankenstein
in a moonlight teteatete
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
oh yes she loves me
dig that shrinking violet
oh she really loves me
here's one gal you'll never get
she lo lo loves me
would you like to make a bet
i said the lady loves me
the gentleman's all wet
where it began, i can't begin to knowing
but then i know it's growing strong
was in the spring
then spring became the summer
who'd have believed you'd come along
hands, touching hands
reaching out, touching me, touching you
sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i'd be inclined
to believe they never would
but now i
look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
we filled it up with only two
and when i hurt
hurting runs off my shoulder
how can i hurt when i'm holding you?
one, touching one
reaching out, toching me, touching you
sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i'd be inclined
to believe they never would
sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i'd be inclined
to believe they never

drugstore cowboy criticizing
acting like he's better than you and me

second guessing people all day long
pushing, fooling and hanging on in

the first time ever i saw your face
i thought the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
to the dark and the empty skies my love
to the dark and the empty skies
the first time ever i kissed your mouth

like a trembling heart of a captive bird

i'd been standing on the corner
since a quarter after seven
i was down to my last cigarette
and the clock in the window
had it quarter to eleven
i was watching all the people
passing by me, going places
just the loneliest guy in the town
looking for a friendly smile
but all that i could see were faces
and then, just like the taste of milk and honey
i found the stranger i'd been looking for
the way my cup of love was overflowing
i knew the stranger in the crowd
and i would be strangers no more
love had found us on the corner
at a quarter to eleven
i thought you were too good to be true
all my life i had believed
that angels only live in heaven
but now, we share the taste of milk and honey
each day is sweeter than the day before
my cup of love is overflowing
because the stranger in the crowd
and i would be strangers no more
deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
i found the stranger i'd been looking for
the way my cup of love was overflowing
i knew the stranger in the crowd
and i would be strangers no more
i knew the stranger in the crowd
and i would be strangers no more

ev'ry time you hold me
i'm still not certain that you care
though you keep on saying
you really, really, really love me
do you speak the same words
to someone else when i'm not there?
suspicion, torments my heart
suspicion, keeps us apart
suspicion, why torture me?
ev'ry time you call me
and tell me we should meet tomorrow
i can't help but think that
you're meeting someone else tonight
why should our romance just
keep on causing me such sorrow?
why am i so doubtful
whenever you're out of sight?
suspicion, torments my heart
suspicion, keeps us apart
suspicion, why torture me?
darling, if you love me
i beg you wait a little longer
wait until i drive all
these foolish fears out of my mind
how i hope and pray that
our love will keep on growing stronger
maybe i'm suspicious
cause true love is so hard to find
suspicion, torments my heart
suspicion, keeps us apart
suspicion, why torture me?
well i remember when i was as children

what now my love
now that you left me
how can i live through another day
watching my dreams turn into ashes
and all my hopes into bits of clay
once i could see, once i could feel
now i'm a numb
i've become unreal
i walk the night, oh, without a goal
stripped of my heart, my soul
what now my love
now that it's over
i feel the world closing in on me
here comes the stars
tumbling around me
and there's the sky where the sea should be
what now my love
now that you're gone
i'd be a fool to go on and on
no one would care, no one would cry
if i should live or die
what now my love
now there is nothing
only my last goodbye
only my last goodbye
i have wished for the wealth
of a great millionaire
i have reached for a bright star above
but the thrill of it all
to me seems so small
when compared to the thrill of your love
i'd rather give everything
that i own in this world
than to be all alone and unloved
for no earthly price and no sacrifice
is too much to give
for your love
i'd rather give everything
that i own in this world
than to be all alone and unloved
for no earthly price and no sacrifice
is too much to give
for your love
i left my home up in the hills far behind me
i left my wife with unpaid bills, she can't find me
i'm trying out the world for size
find that it's not paradise, it's lonely, oh ohh
now for twenty days and twenty nights, i've been alone
and that ain't right without her
city ways are strange to me, i can't make it
for it's not like it ought to be, and i can't take it
i've gotta face the truth one day
man can't always run away from trouble
no, now for twenty days and twenty nights, i've been a fool
and that ain't right without her
oh, one day soon i'm goin' back, where she still mind me
ah, when i'm out of line and off the track, but that's behind me
i fooled around and did it well
but i just couldn't ring the bell without her, no
it's taken twenty days and twenty nights
to prove me wrong and make her right
twenty days and twenty nights
i was wrong and she was right, all along
and i miss her
oh, how i miss her
oh, how i miss her
oh, how i miss her

in the countryside so i went for a ride
but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze
sun didn't smile i didn't care
i decided to try just one more time
to let you know i really love you so
before i arrived i saw you go away
with another guy, a tear filled my eye
but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze

a long time has past since that day i cried
life is fine and i'm doin' fine
when i'm at home and i feel all alone

but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze
sun didn't smile i didn't care

as they gently walk across the lonely floor
and a voice is softly saying
darling this will be goodbye for evermore
there goes my reason for living
there goes the one of my dreams
there goes my only possession
there goes my everything
as my memory turns back the pages
i can see the happy years we've had before
now the love that kept this heart beating
has been shattered by the closing of the door

born in the heat of the desert
my mother died giving me life
deprived of the love of a father
blamed for the loss of his wife
you know lord i've been in a prison
for something that i never done
it's been one hill after another
i've climbed them all one by one
but this time, lord you gave me a mountain
a mountain you know i may never climb
it isn't just a hill any longer
you gave me a mountain this time
my woman got tired of heartaches
tired of the grief and the strife
so tired of working for nothing
just tired of being my wife
she took my one ray of sunshine
she took my pride and my joy
she took my reason for living
she took my small baby boy
but this time, lord you gave me a mountain
a mountain you know i may never climb
it isn't just a hill any longer
you gave me a mountain this time
we are traveling in the footsteps
of those who've gone before
but we'll all be reunited
on a new and sunlit shore
oh when the saints go marching in

oh lord i want to be in that number
when the saints go marching in
and when the sun refuse  to shine
and when the sun refuse  to shine
oh lord i want to be in that number

oh lord i want to be in that number

like before in you fingertips
you're trying hard not to show it
baby, baby i know it
you've lost that lovin' feelin'
oh that lovin' feelin'
you've lost that lovin' feelin'
now it's gone, gone, gone
there's no tenderness in your eyes

cause baby, something beautiful is dying
you've lost that lovin' feelin'

listen to me, talkin' to you
bring back that lovin' feelin
oh that lovin' feelin'
bring back that lovin' feelin'
now it's gone, gone, gone
and i can't go on
her eyes tell the story so well
she tries hard to hide
so little expected too often neglected
a woman stripped of her pride
always so careful not to cry
until i fall asleep
and there in the silence
she lies with a tear on her cheek
the thought comes to mind that i've relived somehow
for herein i can't quite recall
that a man without love's only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all
she knows i don't love her
although heaven knows how i try
her reason for living is to go right on giving
one thing that she's gon' be mine
without any warning in the wee hours
of the morning, she cries
her deep inside she cries so to hide
is beginning to show in her eyes
and a thought comes to mind that i've relived sometime
for herein i can't quite recall
that a man without love's only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all
yeah, a man without love's only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all
when i said, i needed you
you said you would always stay
it wasn't me who changed, but you
and now you've gone away
don't you know that now you're gone?
and i'm left here on my own
now i have to follow you
and beg you to come home
you don't have to say you love me
just be close at hand
you don't have to stay forever
i will understand
believe me, believe me
i can't help but love you
but believe me, i'll never tie you down
left alone with just a memory
life seems dead and so unreal
all that's left is loneliness
there's nothing left to feel
you don't have to say you love me
just be close at hand
you don't have to stay forever
i will understand
believe me, oh believe me oh
you don't have to say you love me
just be close at hand
you don't have to stay forever
i will understand
believe me, believe me, believe me
you give your hand to me
and then you say hello
and i can hardly speak
my heart is beating so
and anyone can tell
you think you know me well
but you don't know me
no, you don't know the one
who thinks of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips
and longs to hold you tight
to you i am just a friend
and that's all i've ever been
no, you don't know me
for i never knew the art of making love
no, my heart aches with love for you
afraid and shy, i let my chance go by
the chance that you might love me too
you give your hand to me
and then you say goodbye
i watch you walk away
beside the lucky guy
too never, never know
the one who love you so
no, you don't know me
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbow turns the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay
when the memories that linger into my heart
memories that make my heart go cold
however some day they gonna live again sweetheart
and my blue moon again will turn to gold
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbow turns the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay
when the memories that linger in my heart
memories they gonna make my heart grow cold
well, you know some day they gonna live again sweetheart
and my blue moon again will turn to gold
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbow turns the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay
if i knew the way i'd go back home
the countryside has changed so much, i'd surely end up lost
halfremembered names and faces so far in the past
on the other side of the bridges
that were burned once they were crossed
tell me where, where does a fool go
when there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
tell me where, where does a fool go
when he knows there's something missing
tell me where, where will i go from here
where will i go from here
get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes
still are none of my regrets
go back to a place where i can figure all the odds
have a fighting chance to lose the blues
and win my share of bets
tell me where, where does a fool go
when there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
tell me where, where does a fool go
when he knows there's something missing
tell me where, where will i go from here
where will i go from here
tell me where, where does a fool go
when there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
tell me where, where does a fool go
when he knows there's something missing
tell me where, where will i go from here
where will i go from here
tell me where, where does a fool go
when there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
tell me where, where does a fool go
when he knows there's something missing
tell me where, where will i go from here
where will i go from here
tell me where, where does a fool go
when there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
tell me where, where does a fool go
when he knows there's something missing
tell me where, where will i go from here
where will i go from here
baby, you've been lying to me
now i'm onto you
it's the same old song
but it doesn't ring true
that's right, you're wrong again
time to change and put you on your own again
you've had your way too long
time for me to be moving on
you gotta stop, you're wrong again
stop that song again
you've been steppin' out wild and fancy free
now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
it just can't be if there's no harmony
then stop!
that's all let's break it up
you've had me fooled now i'm wakin' up
i see right through your lies
you made me open my eyes
you gotta stop, you're wrong again
stop that song again
it's too late now i've made up my mind
being here with you is just a waste of time
nothing to say so i'll be on my way
stop!
you gotta stop, you're wrong again
stop that song again
it's too late now i've made up my mind
being here with you is just a waste of time
it just can't be if there's no harmony
then stop!
stop, you're wrong again
stop that song again
stop, you're wrong again
you gotta stop that song again
stop!
i'm on the right track for lots of kissin'
so that old greenback, i won't be missin'
all the greatest things in life are free
who needs money, not me
cash or credit, it doesn't matter
long as my bank books keep growin' fatter
easy street is my favorite avenue
who needs money, i do
just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
because they're always worryin' about their income tax
why waste time on high financin', i'd rather spend it on good romancin'
what if my pockets are empty as can be
who needs money, not me
tell me about it
some folks save it, some folks lend it
but as for me i want to spend it
give me some green and my skies will be blue
who needs money, i do
stocks and bonds, they only bore me
interest holds no interest for me
who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
who needs money, not me
when i go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
i start counting dollar bills and then i fall asleep
making money never thrills me
it's making love that really kills me
what can i lose with my philosophy
who needs money, not me
what do you want
i want a big yacht, i can cruise in
the kind that girls just can't refuse in
all it takes is a million or two
who needs money, i do
any time some gal starts flirtin'
now that i'm broke i know for certain
she really digs my personality
tell me, who needs money not me
poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
so rich or poor it pays to have money
a gal who's tender, that's what i love
it's legal tender, i want a pile of
just let my liquid assets overflow
you can't take it with you when you go
so, who needs money
that lovely, lovely money
who needs money, not me
when you walk through a storm hold your head up high
and don't be afraid of the dark
at the end of a storm is a golden sky
and the sweet silver song of a lark
walk on through the wind
walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tossed and blown
walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never, ever walk alone
walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never, ever walk alone
long ago and far away
my old common labor shoes
i turned the world all which a way
just because you asked me to
likened to no other feel
summer love is simple true
there's no end of what i'd do
just because you asked me to
let the world call me a fool
what if things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to
knowin' how much i love you
after all i've been through
i'd turn and walk away from you
just because you asked me to
let the world call me a fool
what if things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to
let the world call me a fool
what if things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to
let the world call me a fool
what if things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to
